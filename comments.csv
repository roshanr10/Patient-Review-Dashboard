https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Amanda_Klein html, Amanda Klein ,I have never written a poor review for any Doctor I see multiple doctors across many specialities and practices This Doctor isn't worth the paper her medical degree is printed on I came to Malden's Primary Care office of CHA because my new PCP is there I have an infected finger which needs to be drained It's a relatively simple procedure and I just decided to do it myself because after waiting 2 hours this lady decided we would do nothing but prescribe an antibiotic and come back in 3 days I've already been on an antibiotic for 2 weeks  No thanks to the other useless provider I saw here  I had to go to my old provider to get a simple antibiotic   I'm responsible for my own medical care I appreciate advice but when there are options  I get the final say I know my own body This lady didn't even have the courtesy to explain herself  she sent the student doctor back in I will never be back here You've had two times to redeem yourself and nothing ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Andrew_Dilernia html, Andrew C Dilernia ,It was a waste of our precious time and energy It took our 90 year old mother seven wasted office visits to get an antibiotic from Dr Dilernia My mom could not get rid of her walking pneumonia with all these antibiotics that are wrong for her condition Eventually a partner found the correct antibiotic  when this doctor was away  I've never seen this kind of incompetence by an experienced internist ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Andrew_Dilernia html, Andrew C Dilernia ,Dr Dilernia and his staff have the courtesy manners and style of a doctor's office from 30 years ago taking the time to understand you as a human being and diagnosing you accordingly ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Andrew_Dilernia html, Andrew C Dilernia ,Hmmmm What to say about a doctor who misdiagnosed my entire family as malingerers First it was my cousin with migrains  Dr Dilernia waited over a year to give him an MRI and a specialist referal It was a brain tumor that was caught too late Myself  depression and pain syndrome then a virus It turned to be Lyme annd a thousand other things all related to an immune system defect an inherited metabolic disease encephalitis  discharged me from Emerson's E R over and over again as depressed  No appologies He lied to his staff to say I was poor needy and no illness and has been tampering with my medical records which is why his office refuses to send out my records He diliberately does not document visits phone calls voicemails faxes and test results My brother was misdiagnosed with a concussion from Andrew and Emerson E R physicians  he actually had epileptic induced schizophrenia from a traumatic brain injury He called my mother over weight and told her she just needed to exercise a year before she passed from a fatal genetic illness he wouldn't educate us about or give the children genetic counseling referals He has no money becuase he settles his lawsuits out of court Brotherhood of the wolf ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anne_Marie_Treadup html, Anne Marie Treadup ,I have had Dr Treadup for several years now and the front end staff is horrible In the past couple of years I have called for sick related issues and was told to go to the ER or Urgent Care because they are booked What good is a doctor if you can't see them when you need them Not to mention I had to call them back because it had been over 24 hrs and my call was never addressed or returned I ended up going to Urgent Care and was very pleased with there service ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anne_Marie_Treadup html, Anne Marie Treadup ,Doctor takes her time for the appointment listens and refers out for necessary appointments The front desk always schedules my specialty appointments before I leave ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Zwaan html, Anthony C Zwaan ,dropped as a patient with no warning claimed to have mailed a letter almost caused a lapse in my insurance coverage and my ability to seek further coverage for several issues I was dealing with ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Zwaan html, Anthony C Zwaan ,He spends time with his patients  he gets to know them personally when he studies previous medical history asks questions answers questions is available in an emergency situation He is on top of what is happening in his profession because he is so active at the ground level with all kinds of patients I think How lucky I feel that he is a private practioner wow He doesn't have 4 500 patients Those he has he knows really has the overall picture How blessed I feel thank you ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,I had been a patient of Dr Rocha for a few years and while my health held up he was an okay doctor With my yearly visits I would imagine I was an easy payday for him  as a young and fairly active and healthy person there wasn't much he had to do The standard appointment consisted of a urine test some blood work and a quick 3 minute consultation in which he would continually warn me about the fluid in my legs and inquire about a thyroid issue that I had not had for quite a few years  Guess he did not care to read my chart prior to the consultation   However I contracted a viral chest infection that left me with no sense of smell taste and experiencing a variation of neurological symptoms After a load of tests run  specified and directed by me he did not even offer this  nothing was conclusive I was only referred to a couple of specialists at MY request and was sent away with pills anti depressants and Jesus pamphlets and told that this was just my new condition No other direction other than I simply had to adapt This is the care you get at Dr Rocha's As for the rest of the practice the phlebotomist has the social skills of a flea The receptionists are polite enough but look bored and bothered most of the time especially when you approach the desk upon arrival/departure Also good luck if you are trying to reach the office by phone  NO ONE picks up the phone I have been trying to call all week to have my medical records forwarded to my new GP and no one has picked up I have even attempted to reach the emergency help desk for information and was hung up on as well God help you if you are seriously ill and require immediate care  you will not get it at this place Given the shortage in GP's they know they can abuse their patients as there are little options to go to other practices given long waits insurance coverage etc They are laughing all the way to the bank and cashing in on the misery of their patients Once upon a time this place was a decent practice I initially went there as my parents were patients and he was a good doctor But it seems time and aging has made Dr Rocha lethargic and lazy as well as his team who are evidentially following his lead A doctor's work and learning is continual  a doctor should be curious and investigative so he may better serve his patients  a doctor should offer answers and/or options not shrugs ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,Dr Rocha has been treating me for around 10 years He has always been a very caring Dr I have never been dissatisfied with his treatment ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,I just read some of these reviews and they are not true Dr Rocha prides himself with the type of care he gives to his patient I have been a patient there for 15 years and have nothing but good to say of this man and his staff Highly recommended ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,This guy told be nothing was wrong with my back years later I'm sitting here with a failed back fusion partial paralysis The MRI that he sent for provided him with clues that he refused to acknowledge ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,Great doctor,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,First and foremost I want to than Dr Rocha for some of the most compassionate and comprehensive care that I have ever had All MD's have strengths and weaknesses but this Doctor's strengths are unusual Not only does he engage to understand the problem he takes the time to understand the Person His strength in addition to being a good Doctor is that he understands and empathizes with people Thanks,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,Lord Please tell me why this doctor is still practicing medicine His bedside manners are terrible his wife works in the office she is brutal blonde at the front desk over prescribes medicine for people with small issues eg soft tissue injuries that will eventually heal over time none the less Im in recovery for habitual use of Vicodin Im also 9 years clean Thanks Dr Rocha for introducing me to legal drugs ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,Both my parents are patients of Dr Rocha he and his staffs professionalism quality care follow uo and follow through is something unmatched amongst many doctors across our nation He brings the family back into health care and treats patients like they were his family and not just another patient in his day or just another co pay payment received We wish we could have him as our doctor in Virginia His staff is just as caring and professional as the doctor they work for truly these folks are rare gems ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Aram_Kaligian html, Aram V Kaligian ,I was traveling while working on a cruise ship and required medical attention while in Boston After trying to meet with various doctors who would not take the time to understand my situation I was SO lucky to find Dr Kaligian at South Boston Health He was professional empathetic charismatic and attentive My needs were met and my mind is eased  I am now reassured that there ARE people out there who TRULY care about your well being ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Aram_Kaligian html, Aram V Kaligian ,I waited over 35 mins for the doctor to finally show up He introduced himself and hurriedly asked me what was wrong didn't bother logging into the computer system to see any of my stats or anything about me as every doctor I have ever seen has done I tell him my symptoms and it was as if he didn't even listen to me he immediately told me to go home and take some motrin Never examined me asked me very few questions and came to that conclusion It was as if he was in a huge rush and I was just an annoyance to him I asked if he could at least examine me and he said he'd be right back  right back apparently means 25 minutes to this doctor as I sat on the table in a gown that only covered part of me so my entire front was exposed After the examination he repeated the same thing go home and take motrin I told him I've been doing that and I'm still in severe pain and had been for a week that was the end of the appointment I left there upset and crying felt like this a hole didn't even listen to me and just wanted me out of the office I was there for over an hour and he spent not more than 3 minutes with me total Don't waste your time with this arrogant jerk see another doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Aram_Kaligian html, Aram V Kaligian ,In all honesty he does not listen to what you have to say I keep telling him about the same problem over and over but nothing has really been done to properly diagnose the problem The next day i was still in incredibe dibilitating pain I went to a different hospital I told them the same symptoms I told Dr Kaligian I have been having for months They imediately gave me medicine to help the pain and ordered a test which i was asked why it had not already been done The test showed multiple normalities I have been out of work now for 6 weeks now leaving me with no income right now aswell as waiting to see a surgeon to correct the problem that he neglected to find Dr Kaligian also failed to contact me with results that showed abnormalities I got the results by an error that accured when i recieved a copy of a report that was different than the one that i requested Pure neglegence if you ask me Due to my negative experiences with Dr Aram Kaligian I would strongly recomend seeing someone else I myself will seek legal advice about this matter ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,Thanks for nothing Dr Tracey and Family Medical This practice did nothing for my mother and she ended up in the hospital in a coma and almost died She went to Dr Tracey her primary care numerous times and she did nothing but send her to the emergency room The emergency room did nothing If it wasn't for Mass General Hospital in Boston she wouldn't be alive Family Medical should be shut down because of the way their practice is run What a chaotic unsafe disaster Get as far away as you can from this place and Dr Tracey doesn't even personally see her patients AWFUL ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,They use the emergency room like their own personal overflow Had to take my son up to the ER several times as there were no appointments available Been misdiagonosed several times Doctors never follow up with you even after a serious issue My advice is stay away from the practice Dr Tracey herself is nice but the entire practice is chaos ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,very caring understands my medical problems and how they impact my quality of life ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,Dr Tracey is the best doctor around She delivered my son and has been his Primary care since shes always caring and understanding The whole staff are full of great people ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,My wife and I are in the process of finding another primary care The office help sometimes are clueless when asking question sometimes not very friendly Most of the time we get a misdiagnosis and end up going to another doctor for help which is a rather scary thought Don't know how she stays in business Not happy at all ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,this clinic is a major mess if there is something wrong with me the doctor will simply refer me to a specialist btw I will never see the same person usually one of their assistants will see me rarely the doctor if I call them they just tell me to go to the ER they do not keep track of what they do at all I have been referred to a different specialist for my problems every time I come there and sometimes to a new doctor although I already have a specialist following me I guess she is just too busy counting money to care,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Audrey_Tracey html, Audrey A Tracey ,Wonderful caring doctor with a fabulous bedside manner Office staff is professional and friendly ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Austin_Egan html, Austin P Egan ,Saw Dr Egan to discuss a couple of issues and he was attentive caring and extremely astute highlighting key issues to bear in mind Gave a clear course of action in order to improve symptoms Would highly recommend to other patients ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Austin_Egan html, Austin P Egan ,He has been my primary care physician for the past 4 years My medical history is littered with big and small ailments some life threatening Hence I have met and closely interacted with dozens of doctors throughout my life  those all serve as numerous reference points Dr Egan's service is among the best I've seen He makes careful diagnoses and is thoroughly knowledgeable about medicine However perhaps the most important characteristic that sets him apart is his approach towards patient care He has a very warm presence He listens intently on what is bothering the patient and carefully tries to craft a care plan that caters to the patient's needs which are characteristics probably vital for any primary care physician but is sadly not very common in the general MD world I am more than lucky to have him as my primary care doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Great Dr and always at time,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,I got stuck with Dr Jablow because my company changed providers to Neighborhood Health Plan and I'm having trouble finding another doctor who accepts that insurance She is scarcastic rude and does her very best to make sure that I feel like a piece of insignificant crap when I leave her office She is condescending and scoffs at you when you bring up something concerning I was diagnosed with extremely high blood pressure and she prescribe some medication and didn't even request a follow up appointment to see how I was doing I could drop dead for all she cares I dread going to her and CAN'T WAIT TO FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR SO I CAN'T GET RID OF HER She is that bad Truly ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Always on time easy to talk to very understanding and very professional ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,I am surprised at the number of negative reviews but then I suppose mostly only complaints get reported and given how many patients she has ~10 negative reviews is low I have been a patient for over 20 years and have always found her competent friendly  albeit not warm and fuzzy  helpful concerned and responsive She is a very responsible caregiver  not one to just give out a prescription because the patient wants one I have always found her care excellent and her referrals exemplary and I have and will continue to recommend her to friends and acquaintances ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,I will never go back to hillside because of my experience She is not my primary doctor but I saw her because I was really sick and needed attention right away When I called saying I will be a few minutes late the person I spoke to was kind and said as long as it's by 20 minutes that's no problem I was late because I was too weak to drive and I had to get a ride from someone When I got there the staff was extremely rude and took over 15 minutes to make sure with Jablow that she can still see me while I was about to vomit and couldn't stand long When I finally did she was very cold and pretty much mocked me and kept smirking not taking me seriously Her diagnosis Everyone gets sick and I just need water and anti nausea medication No thorough examination or sympathy I regret going there And I didn't feel better the next day ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,My daughter brought my 3 week old granddaughter in for a sick visit THIS DOCTOR DID NOTHING Dr Jablow told my daughter the baby is junky but not junky enough follow up in two days  The following morning my granddaughter seen at a nearby urgent center A swab was done and showed positive RSV she was transported to Hasbro hospital and was admitted to PICU She is very sick on oxygen IV fluids three types of antibiotics a feeding tube and must be suctioned every two hours Maybe if this doctor had just done her job this would not have happen ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,poo pooed my problem and never put down her thinkpad to get up and examine it Many months later problem was diagnosed by other physician and was operated on less than amonth later ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Dr Jablow cares about your money more than patients concerns ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Curt unkind unpleasant ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Attention to detail helped catch a borderline reading Recommended immediate follow up with a specialist that was imperative in early diagnosis and successful treatment Also went above and beyond in helping walk me through my options and with encouragement throughout the process I feel she has done an exceptional job and I highly value her abilities and professionalism ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Went with a bad sinus infection and a completely clogged ear and the doctor didn't give me any medicine to take Just said if I get a headache take a over the counter pain reliever Doesn't have a good attitude seems kind of miserable Would not recommend unless absolutely needed to see a doc ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barbara_Jablow html, Barbara W Jablow ,Was a patient of hers for years She is competent but has zero compassion and poor relating skills She refused to give me anything but an over the counter poison ivy remedy when I had it so bad on my arms I couldn't bend my elbows I ended up going to the ER for cortisone and steroid treatment They couldn't believe she gave me nothing Distrustful of her patients what more can I say ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barry_Kaye html, Barry N Kaye ,Dr Kaye is a wonderful FAMILY clinician So happy that he is my whole families physician ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barry_Kaye html, Barry N Kaye ,Dr Kaye is a rude mean nasty doctor I ask him questions and he just about tears my head off His attitude is not becoming of a Doctor I will be looking for another Primary Care Physician I don't like him Doctor's are supposed to be courteous and understanding He sure isn't He refuses to write a letter for work excusing me from shoveling snow but yet he writes a letter stating that I've had a history if Siatica and should not do any repeated bending or heavy lifting What do you think shoveling snow is A picnic I'm no spring chicken I'll be 60 years old next year and I don't feel I should be shoveling snow with my back problems and Siatica It seems all the young people get letters saying that they shouldn't shovel snow but the older people get treated like GARBAGE That's what I have to say If he doesn't like it then Tough Bananas ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Barry_Kaye html, Barry N Kaye ,I recently told DR Kaye the reason I am still seeing him is the care and concern he showed on my first visit after domestic abuse issues at the time 18 years ago The other thing his telling me he DIDN'T KNOW about an injury I had and referred me to some who would know I have had many medical issues since that visitwith referrals to many specialists each as caring as He is ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bassem_Hanna html, Bassem G Hanna ,I have found Dr Hanna a couple of years ago i will be forever grateful Such a caring warm person Yes he's not just a doctor he is a real human being    He always listens we talk as if we were friends we laugh He is gentle and giving caring and responsive good listener He makes you feel as if you are his only patient and let's face it you are not He is a very busy doctor rightfully so but makes you feel as if you were the only patient and that is very special So knowledgeable approachable and good spirited Five thumbs up ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bassem_Hanna html, Bassem G Hanna ,Dr Hanna is a caring doctor with a dedicated staff My family's grateful we found this practice ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bassem_Hanna html, Bassem G Hanna ,I switched to Dr Hanna after my PCP of 20+ years retired He asks lots of questions and listens to responses  and he circles back to older issues He is not quick to prescribe but rather tries to get at root of complaint and discuss options I highly recommend ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bassem_Hanna html, Bassem G Hanna ,I arrive 8 minutes late and he wouldn't see me for my appt His staff treated me like a child late for supper Schedule a new appt NO get a new doctor ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bijoy_Kundu html," Bijoy L Kundu, ",I honestly cannot give Dr Kundu a good rating No matter what the doctor's visit was for she would always tell me it was normal And her office staff even said that she never listens to her patients That is when I changed doctor's If I had stayed with her I probably would have died ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,i will always go to her she was lovely,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,I absolutely love Dr Geddis Comrie She is fantastic when it comes to explaining things and really takes the time to listen I don't visit her often but she remembers me and the little details that other doctors wouldn't normally remember or even care about She spends quality time with me and never makes me feel rushed I would suggest her to loved ones and friends ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,very disappointed in follow up by office staff chronic problem like i have a scarlet letter on my head  M D is okay ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,She doesn't have the time to spend with or even listens to what you say it took an entire year before she was able to diagnose my problem even after I told her exactly what the problem was in the first visit just doesn't believe you I'm very frustrated with this lady maybe she shouldn't have been a doctor Stay away from this one ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,She forgets the medications she puts me on She has lied to me and my wife on at least 3 differnt ocasions and has no follow up on me or my wife ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,Dr Geddis is the best doctor I have ever dealt with She is caring makes you feel at ease Haven't had a doctor like her in 30 years She is no longer at UMass and I am trying to find her Will not find a better doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,She was great with me serious at first while getting all the informations then she lightened up like her a lot but she suddenly up and left the clinic Nobody knew where she went ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,I have been going to this family practice for years and I know the staff can be rude at times but they are all overworked and the office is located in a very busy hospital I saw the other rating and know that if she was taking on other doctors appointments  which happens a lot because there are a few flaky doctors in there  there may have been a delay but isn't that pretty normal in most cases I had to wait a long time before and actually asked what was the hold up She told me exactly why she was delayed and made no excuses She is one of the most kind hearted and genuinely caring physicians I have ever had She has been very supportive and has even called me later in the evening in person to ensure I was doing OK and made sure any referral appointments were all set before I leave her office Quite simply she is the best PCP I have ever had ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brenda_Geddis-Comrie html, Brenda J Geddis-Comrie ,she made me wait for 1 and half hours in her office she fianlly came in after I asked for her 3 times and after coming in she didnt even apologise for the wait She has horrible bedside manners I will probably never go back to her Even at the end of the visit she didnt tell me what was wrong I had to ask her what was wrong she is a really bad doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brett_Hurteau html, Brett Hurteau ,My daughter had back pain that she was sure was internal and not muscular like urgent care had said Dr Hurteau listened to us and did the tests that we felt were necessary to find the problem He sent us to Boston to a specialist I am very thankful that he was humble and patient enough to listen to us rather than just assuming he knew better and also that he was humble enough to send us to a specialist My family and I have been with him for 6 years We only went in for yearly physicals until my daughter's health problem but he has always been kind compassionate and a good listener ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brett_Hurteau html, Brett Hurteau ,I have had him as my PCP for about 8 months and have seen him 4 times He has been very kind to me He listens & never rushes me at all I trust his judgment His staff is very nice also Professional but down to earth ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brett_Hurteau html, Brett Hurteau ,Very pleased with care and service provided Highly competent ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brett_Hurteau html, Brett Hurteau ,Dr Hurteau is a joke He's more concerned with padding his pockets then he is at being a good dr If you don't schedule enough appointments he'll drop you as a patient It's all about the money with this dr He schedules un necessary medical tests just to make more money Do youself a favor  Find a doctor who's interested in what You have to say ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brett_Hurteau html, Brett Hurteau ,My husband fell and broke his leg Toby sent him to Boston When it cam time for a follow up appointment we made one with a local orthopaedic doctor We showed up at the appointment and needed a referral According to insurance they said we didn't Anyway we didn't have a primary care I saw Dr Hurteaus office and stopped in to see if they were taking new patients The receptionist said yes I explained what was going on to her and she said he was available next week Dr Hurteau over heard about my husband's leg and said he would see ys right now Not only did he see us at the drop of a dime but also made sure he was seen by an orthopedic doctor that same day Very amazing experience Thank you ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brett_Hurteau html, Brett Hurteau ,Had a horrible experience with this doctor as my pcp I saw him for about a year complaining of agonizing fatigue and a host of other symptoms i was unable to work due to my condition but didnt know what was causing it Turns out i had chronic lyme disease i was diagnosed no help to him but rather a friend who suggested i see a lyme specialist During that year of not knowing what was disabling me dr Hurteau made me feel like i was a complete head case he talked down to me and i even left his office in tears a couple of times hes probably okay to see if you have no real serious problems but if its something he cant help you with watch out he ll let you know about it then make you feel as if its your fault your sick or its just in your head would not ever go back to this doctor ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Claussen html, Brian E Claussen ,Dr Clausen is thorough and spends so much time educating and listening to his patients a true and dedicated professional,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Claussen html, Brian E Claussen ,He seemed young when we first visited him 17 years ago He is still the PCP for myself my wife and our 15 year old son Really nice guy he is concerned for his patients health and well being and doesn't just prescribe medicine but looks for solutions to the root problems The only reason I don't want to recommend him is selfish we have to schedule a physical more than a year out His PA's nurses and admin staff are all also excellent ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,Great doctor who goes out of his way to make sure you understand him and he understands you Have never left his office without a clear understanding of what is going on ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,Great for the colds Not so great at listening or the dealing with anything that needs to be treated for more than a week Had to bring in social services with a nurse case manager to get a referral to a specialist One month later I have a new diagnosis that he simply said nope can't be that oh you can't be having those symptoms Also I received a copy of my records from him Which stated he spoke to me about topics and concerns when he never spoke a word of it to me Bottom line doesn't take the times to listen Seek better care ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,Dr K has been my son's PCP since he was a year old He has always been very good to him He makes your visits comfortable even when you get shots :  He takes time to listen and talk to you about your concerns He is always on top of my son's medical issues and proactive My son loves going to see him12 years later,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,He is a very good doctor He shows concern and compassion My husband and I have been seeing him for a few years we see him at the Wilcox Family Center in Buttonwoods And all our review will be directed to the Wilcox Center ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,I was a patient of Dr Kwetkowski for 5 years At first I was a little put off by the office  as it was a little out dated but after meeting Dr K and his staff I could have cared less Dr K was very down to earth personable and thorough Unlike most Drs I have met he actaully listened to what you were saying answered any questions you had and never ever rushed you out of the office I do not know the details of this situation however it is a shame that his gift of healing is no longer being shared ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,Dr Kwetkowski's a nice guy and a so so doctor I guess none of that matters anymore though because he just lost his medical license because he's been having an affair with a young patient for three years ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Kwetkowski html, Brian G Kwetkowski ,DR KWETKOWSKI IS WONDERFULLY THOROUGH AND I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Mcfadden html, Brian L Mcfadden ,Unprofessional demeanor unapproachable cruel to his office staff ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Mcfadden html, Brian L Mcfadden ,My appointment was early in the morning I might have even been the first one he seen for the day but I got in within 5 minutes of checking in Overall very professional in asking his questions I did feel rushed though Took 3 weeks to get a follow up appointment for blood tests to find out what was causing my symptoms ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Brian_Mcfadden html, Brian L Mcfadden ,Very bad experience Wouldn't let this doctor touch my dog's feeces My advice Don't walk RUN ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_Churchill html, Bruce H Churchill ,I am very fortunate to have Dr Churchill as my primary care physician He's smart he takes enough time he follows up he's accessible he answers emails quickly his staff loves him  always important to me  he's honest and he cares deeply about his patients My only worry is that someday some other hospital/group/institution will woo him away from HUGHP/HUHS If I could change my insurance I'd certainly follow him there He'd get five stars if there were five ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_W_Smith_2 html, Bruce W Smith ,Have been going to him for 6+ years Listens and cares Knows what he's talking about lots of experience,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_W_Smith_2 html, Bruce W Smith ,My husband and I have been going to Dr Bruce Smith since 2003 His attentive listening and actual concern regarding our physical health is an exceptional example among physicians today He does not just prescribe pills to move you along as so many physicians and care centers do He will only prescribe if the product will actually help heal and overcome the problem He evaluates the cause of the issue and looks at both short and long term solutions ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_W_Smith_2 html, Bruce W Smith ,Been a patient of Dr Smith for over 25 years He is the best ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_W_Smith_2 html, Bruce W Smith ,Takes the time to listen and asks great questions,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_W_Smith_2 html, Bruce W Smith ,I'm still here and able to write this review because of Dr Smith's early and accurate diagnosis  multiple times He recommended and made appointments with the right specialist in a timely manner ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Bruce_W_Smith_2 html, Bruce W Smith ,I had a very bad experience He was rude and incompetent I was misdiagnosed ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Budio_Thomas html, Budio J Thomas ,I have been going to Dr Thomas for 12 years and he has been great seeing and treating me I hate to change from him even though I moved away from his location ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Caitlin_Mann html, Caitlin L Mann ,I was stuck with Dr Mann after my regular PCP at the practice left She is rude and very arrogant She doesn't listen or believe medical diagnoses made by specialists I stuck it out as long as I could and finally switched to another doctor and love him I wish I had switch a long time ago I have many medical issues and she failed to address any of them When I got to my new PCP he ordered the many tests that I should have had while being under Dr Mann's care Very poor bedside manner and very dictative ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Caitlin_Mann html, Caitlin L Mann ,Always on time friendly and personable smart with great bedside manner Reception staff needs work minus one girl who is always friendly and helpful Rachel I believe it is Nurses and medical assistants also great ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Caitlin_Mann html, Caitlin L Mann ,I would give Dr Mann more than 4 stars if I were able to I have never met a Dr who seems to actually care about their patients as much as she seems to You actually get the feeling she wants the best for you You don't usually find a Dr like that and if you do they aren't a PCP who can take care of all your health care needs to a point She spends just enough time with you that you don't feel that your being rushed out She will answer any and all questions you have and will make sure you understand it Sometimes you don't even end up having to ask what you were going to because she ends up covering it on her own She also has a great staff working under her The medical assistant / nurses that bring you to the room and take vitals etc are always friendly ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Caitlin_Mann html, Caitlin L Mann ,I am ecstatic that I found Dr Mann several years ago I Finally found a doctor who doesn't make you wait months for an appointment and most importantly who listens carefully and wants to spend more than 2 minutes with a patient She and her staff are fabulous She takes the time to explain everything to me answer all my questions and made makes me feel very much at ease I tend to get stressed out at doctor appointments /office visits and she always makes me feel very comfortable I highly recommend her if she accepts new patients again ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Caitlin_Mann html, Caitlin L Mann ,Nothing but good things to say about Dr Mann No complaints,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Dubois html, Carol J Dubois ,First appt waited 2 hours she wake in the room and first words are what are you here for Should be hi my name is Dr Dubois how can I help you Walk out told staff bed side manner suck she asked me if I was serious my answer yes Will never return ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Dubois html, Carol J Dubois ,I have been seeing Dr carol for 18 yrs or more and now when I go for visits she is very rude She lies a lot She acts like she doesn't care She adds more stress to my life What Dr does that I will be looking for a new doctor Her staff is constantly changing At least every 6 mos new front desk girl She likes her front desk girls to be rude Went to get a refill on my prescription and I had wait to she her pay 20 00 just to get my prescription She is all about money If I were you I would stay far away from this office ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Dubois html, Carol J Dubois ,more than a professional,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Dubois html, Carol J Dubois ,It is next to impossible to get through on the phone For non emergency but important communication getting through to the doctor requires hours of time pushing redial to talk to office staff  and then the office staff will call back with an answer or you need to make an appointment ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick ,this provider started out her exam of my son by walkingin and saying i don't understand why you are here she did misdiagnosis and continued to be rude,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick , Doctor Olnick diagnosed my mom with a sinus infection and bronchitis A month later she died from lung cancer and a tumor in her liver the size of a grape fruit Don't play doctor if you don't care about people Money money money I'll never forget her carelessness and how cold she was the night my mom died Thanks Olnick I'm only giving 1 star so this review actually shows up Don't go see this woman she doesn't care about you just your money ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick ,my dr had left the practice and somehow I got stuck seeing dr olnick my experience with her was the same as the other reviews gave me a pill that I didn't want and when I complained about the side effects she said the pill couldn't cause those side effects before I took the pill and when I stopped taking it I was fine every follow up apt she became more arrogant rude and acted like I was bothering her isn't that what I'm paying her for finally left the practice and couldn't be happier I thought it was just me at first but I'm glad to see that I wasn't the only one who had issues with her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick ,I'm not sure why Dr Olnick chose to be a doctor because she is really awful at communicating w/ patients She has a terrible bedside manner doesn't listen speaks over you and lacks any empathy I could go over the details of my visit but they are very similar to the other comments outlined here I switched PCP's after my visit with her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick ,Six years ago my mother was feeling sick and loosing a lot of weight She went to see her Doctor Dr Carol Olnick who at that time was at the Derry Medical Center Each time my mother came home she said the doctor said there was nothing wrong with her My mothers weight was at 83lbs The next time I went to the doctor with my mother Dr Carol Olnick ask me what I was doing there I told her that I was worried about my mother The notes she was writing down were just not correct She told me that there was nothing wrong with her except she needed a phyciatrist She never did any tests This had been going on for 5 months I ended up taking my mother to another Doctor My mother had cancer By this time it was too late for her Her cancer was spreading rapidly She died a few months later My mother may have lived if she received proper medical care from the beginning This woman should not be allowed to keep her medical licence Other doctors at this same facility new there was a problem Another doctor at this same facility examined my mother and they were the ones that diagnosed her You did not need to be a doctor to know this woman was in serious ill health I did nothing about this at the time I was just to emotional and nothing would bring her back If anyone cares about their health do not see this doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick ,Dr Olnick has terrible bedside manner does not listen and orders needless tests She actually laughed at me when I told her that I was concerned about a lump I found in my breast Don't bother with her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Olnick html, Carol L Olnick ,My Dr left the facility I had been going to for the last few years  so I needed to find a new Dr I hadn't been to a Dr for a while  and had been having some odd body/health issues that I wanted to find out about  and my friends and family had been urging me to see a doctor for My friends recommended that I make a list of the things that were happening and bring it to my new doctor  which sounds reasonable to me  your Dr *should* know what's going on with you  right   so I could find out what was going on with me At my first visit with Dr Olnick  I tried to talk to her about these things and took out the list so I would remember everything It really wasn't a long list  maybe 5 7 things that I thought were probably nothing serious  but wanted to know what they were and what to do about them Apparently  having made a list of  I will quote here from her office notes  multiple  multiple issues  I was obviously a hypochondriac She zoomed in on the first thing I brought up  prescribed a pill  asked if I wanted another pill to help me sleep  brushed off the next two things I tried to ask her about  and wouldn't even LET me get to anything else I thought it was because I was the last appointment of the day and she was tired and hadn't had lunch  so she was rushing The next appointment  I didn't bring a list  but it was the same thing I was irritated  but didn't really get what was going on until I read her office notes She painted a pretty clear picture of what she thought of me there She made me sound as ridiculous as she could without actually using the word hypochondriac  and even put in things I told her that were the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what I actually told her  to make me sound even worse And I'm pretty sure she doesn't even think I *have* the issue she's medicating me for  by the way she worded things Maybe she figured if she just gave me a pill for it  it would shut me up She hasn't followed up on it either  I just call every month to renew the prescription And I believe you're supposed to have some kind of counselling to go along with the meds for this There was no testing  just a few questions  and she prescribed a pill After that  she wanted nothing more to do with me She had done her dcotorly duty and fixed my problem So now I won't go to her for ANYTHING  and I'm trying to find a new doctor  but after they read her office notes  they'll think I'm ridiculous before they even talk to me I really don't know what to do with this Why would someone become a doctor if they don't actually want to BE a doctor And why assume someone is a hypochondriac because they aren't completey normal  If it's not worth the hassle to find out what's going on  you need a different career path I'm thinking I need a REAL doctor  who listens without judging  and looks into the issues to make sure there really is nothing going on Apparently  caring about your patients went out with the House Call ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Levitt html, Carol S Levitt ,doctor levitt very cold and don't get to know her patient's in 45 min she make decision on me with out realy knowing me stay as far away from her you wait over 2 to 3 hours to see her,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Levitt html, Carol S Levitt ,doctor levitt make her own decision and don't get to know here patient well enough she very opinonated and put it a pond you and you have no say in what her doing,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Yo she sucks,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,This MD office is disorganized but has improved from several years ago when the office was a complete disaster  medical records stacked on the floor in disarray stressed out receptionist etc  She hires non medical staff to check you in & take vital signs & current history so she doesn't have to pay them much The wait time is long & you must expect 1  2 hours before even being seen for me it was a whole day event to see her She routinely prescribed me multiple meds that needed monthly refills & she requires you to return monthly to see her for refills  I think she does that to get patients coming in just for refills so you are in & out quick when you finally see her & she gets insurance payments for your visit  If you have monthly med refills needed then you must fill out paperwork monthly It is clearly done to cover her involvement if you have a medication issue it reduces or clears her of any medical complications you may have from all the meds she prescribes She had a partner MD in her office who lost his license for over prescribing narcotics a few years ago She tightened up her practice after that but with her non medical staff her office still struggles to be organized She has certain pain patients  her receptionists term  that get narcotic pain meds & other controlled meds every month & they need to see her monthly because they become addicted to the meds & need to see her for refills or they will go into withdrawal symptoms  A way to collect easy payments monthly from insurance companies  Every patient receives vitamin D for low vit D levels as her receptionist told me & yes I got put on it too Many patients get a Lyme disease diagnosis & get multiple long term antibiotics like I did You can get confused as to what your own health issues are because she fixates on certain health issues like Lyme I'm giving my honest opinion here & I don't want to speak bad about anyone but you are safer seeing her if you yourself are an RN or medical professional so you can help direct your own care I saw her for 7 years then she suddenly terminated me as a patient after my insurance changed & had me sign something about my termination that I don't remember what it was but i'm sure it must have been something to absolve her of any wrongdoing I was dropped like nothing & then had no PCP to see if I needed one They are right on top of the insurance rules & reg's & will speak to you about insurance issues what your balance is & tell you that they won't see you unless you make payments like they did to me The MD hired someone for just that issue payment & how to maximize insurance $ like adding a list of 10  20 diagnoses that you have that they don't even speak to you about I'm not kidding She's good with preventative health measures & offers suggestions & documents for issues like cardiac & respiratory issues flu prevention etc See her if you have the time & are healthy then you can make your own decision to keep seeing her or not Don't let her staff bother or intimidate you & don't go around 1 pm when they all leave for their lunch hour ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Her staff are so rude and arrogant After years of putting up with her and her operation I switched to acton medical I used to see her just beacuse living in harvard it was convenient but i am so much better off now Rude disorganized and arrogant staff ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,I'm honestly surprised this woman is still in practice Extremely unprofessional rude and unhelpful I was referred to her by Tim Jackson regarding MTHFR and Lyme issues as well as other more serious health issues I left her office in tears after waiting two hours to see her then being bullied by her and three of her office staff when she didn't even address the issue I went there for which was very serious and landed me in the hospital When I politely insisted that I have more time with her than the ten minutes she gave after a two hour drive there and additional two hour wait and my issue not being addressed her and her staff blew up at me and stated that I was cutting into their lunch time She prescribed a dangerous antibiotic which should only be used in life or death circumstances due to the black box warning on it Thankfully I'm a nurse and knew this before I took it I would never recommend this doctor to anyone that cares about their health or sanity ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,I had gone there 3 years before and loved my experience I became pregnant and started going to OBGYN and then miscarried Starting working with a fertility specialist and had my records on my Thyroid and Lyme disease sent to the specialist A long 2 year process of working with specialists I had a baby Now having post partum issues and called to make an appointment to review my thyroid and anxiety and they were so rude because I had records transferred I have never dealt with someone so rude and insensitive Wait time even with my pressing problems 2 months and she didn't even want to hear what I needed to be seen for This doctor needs a new nurse ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Watch out She can pop in a second at the bedside if you ask for any supporting documentation on your diagnosis She is smart but not professional in the way in which she handles requests She can be very emotional accusatory and unprofessional ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Doctor fixated on Lyme disease and seems to have no appreciation that the excessive prescribing of antibiotics can result in many of the symptoms she will diagnose The doctor seems to have a true inability to engage in a dialogue and will often jump into long monologues on Lyme disease using tupperware models she has place around her office as props It seems she goes on auto pilot When asked a question her typical response is that's up to you I can't tell you what to do You signed a form  The form she is referring to is a from she has written and asks patients to sign in an attempt to absolve her for liability associated seeing every one who walks through her office doors as a Lyme disease patient Wait time in waiting room and examining room intolerable Staff and the doctor are very unorganized Office staff the doctor herself the office waiting & examining rooms all have an unkept appearance I am wary of web reviews myself but felt compelled to share my experience This doctor and her practice should be under very serious Board scrutiny Her practice is a disaster waiting to happen ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,After seeing over 20 doctors with over 10 inaccurate diagnosis all based on tests  I discovered Dr Carol Savage as an LLMD She accepted me as a new patient I was very pleased as many other LLMDs in the area are not accepting or may have over a 6 month wait Dr Carol Savage is very intelligent and stays very current with tic borne diseases and treatments She continually updates her knowledge and keeps her patients well informed of new treatments She recognizes that tic borne diseases can be very difficult to diagnose She does not 'treat to the test' but listens and carefully goes over your medical symptom logs and tests to ensure her best clinical diagnosis before prescribing any treatment Like all doc offices Dr Savage's office can have an extended wait But all her staff will listen display great care and will ensure you understand your treatment and why Her office manager went above and beyond to ensure my insurance would be accepted Her nurses and secretary have always taken the time to 'chat' and get to know me not the typical 'cattle treatment' like in neighboring large medical institutions My visits have always been pleasant and the staff takes the time to get to know you In all honesty my quality of life has been saved by Dr Savage and her staff As her patient for the past 2 years she has given me my life back ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Dr Savage does not let anyone leave her office until all their questions have been answered which means she spends much more time with you than any other doctor I have been to I highly recommend her skill at diagnosing what ails you Dr Savage successfully treated me when no other doctor could figure out what was wrong with me and that is why I travel over one hour to get to her office Yes you may have to wait 30 minutes in her office before being seen but to me it is well worth the wait knowing that she will more than make up for that when she sees me Her staff are also extremely helpful making sure you don't leave their office until you fully understand what you need in regards to prescriptions tests and follow up appointments I highly recommend Dr Savage and her staff to anyone who needs a doctor who will listen to them and actually hear what their needs are This is no in and out quick fix office who need a computer next to them to figure out who you are Dr Savage and her staff know their patients by name when you walk through their door without looking at a computer screen This type of practice is rare but does give the patient confidence that they are being treated correctly I highly recommend this practice ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Dr Savage was my doctor for many years up until 3 4 years ago I was satisfied with her then things went down hill I was diagnosed with asthma from another room turns out I dont have asthma other peoples files were placed in my folder she diagonsed me with mercia and she and her staff really botched what should have been done to insure that I receive the care I needed the reason it has taken me so long to get another doctor is she had out sorced me to several other doctors and I didn't have to go to her much I realize that Lime dease is serious but I dont have it and I felt that my needs weren't beening addressed when I went in to see her and that was the only thing she'd talk about and thing that went on 5 years ago that was no longer a problem and not what I had come in for now that I have found another doctor his office nor I can get her and/or her staff to send my records to him I have calles 3 times his office has called 2 times still nothing yesterday when I called I was told that it was taking so long because she has to do them by hand' its been almost 2 months I think they should have been sent by now She is a very nice person but I dont want her for my doctor any more also she never once came to check on me on any of my hospital stays even thou she was my PC ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Very sharp bright woman but office policies make working with an illness most difficult I have a 5 week wait to review my lab reports and they won't correspond via mail or e mail I feel uncertain and left hanging I also have waited from 30 70 minutes for my appointment She is rather scatter brained but very thorough ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carrie_Lundeen-Young html, Carrie A Lundeen-Young ,hands out powerful antidepressants like candy No psych evaluation no license certifications or accreditation that are searchable to back up diagnosis Only administered the PHQ 9 and GAD 7 and wrote a prescription I went to this doctor for the first time and had never meet her before Psychologists and psychiatrists highly frown upon this kind of practice All i went for was a physical and now I need mental meds i have been down because i got my period the week before my first time meeting the doctor for a physical Been trying to get pregnant for a year  any woman in my shoes would understand  no concern was shown nor was any real effort to warn me about the side effects of this drug on conception  miscarriages  birth defects and long term side effects of any child i bore Plus no real discussion of the startup side effects duration side effects and discontinuation side effects for me I had to research them all myself And its scary what this medicine can do Buyer beware with this depression and anxiety specialist ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carrie_Lundeen-Young html, Carrie A Lundeen-Young ,I have never had such a negative experience with a Physician than actually going to Dartmouth After half the appt was spent talking about herself and her opinion of the mental health care system in NH we finally got to me and I told her that I smoke marijuana occasionally She immediately judged me suggested condescendingly that I go get a legal card somewhere else because even though I qualify with PTSD she wasn't going to help Then she tried to violate my fourth amendment rights and insisted on a drug test I said Why I just told you She insisted that she would not continue my 30 Vicodin A YEAR AND PUT A PERMANENT NOTE ON MY RECORD narcotics violation Awful Dr If you go see her you cannot be honest so why bother I want my old Dr Back This one couldn't care less about me ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I ended up in the ER because Dr Braga didn't seem to care about my life threatening symptoms After my visit with ER i told him what was going on and what the ER physician suggested i do Braga did not care and pushed me aside I almost died from pneumonia and major heart issues I spent almost a week in the hospital He has no bed side manor and never smiles He is really quick with talking and doing examinations I didnt even have a chance to talk or ask questions before he left the room No thanks will not be seeing him again ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I've been going to DHMC in Manchester since they opened many years ago I've liked the convenience of having many services in one building but was never very happy with the choice of Primary Care docs I fired my last doc there and took a chance and switched to Dr Braga and couldn't be happier Dr Braga is friendly and engaging and doesn't talk down to you He listens to what you have to say and will work with you to figure things out I wish all docs were like Dr Braga ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,Dr Braga doesn't have the best bed side manner I did not feel as though I was really being listened to He seemed rushed and focused on just prescribing me medication Since I only see him once a year I would have expected him to slow down and ask how I was and if there were any issues I wanted to discuss Instead he seemed more focused on prescription renewals and leaving I had to bring up some of my concerns to him namely issues with digestion His solution was to order a test for Celiac I had already told him I eliminated gluten from my diet so asked if there was a reason to do that He said probably not He did not offer any other suggestions I am currently looking for another primary someone who takes time to listen offers a level of empathy and looks at my whole body rather than just band aids to symptoms ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I have had Dr Baraga as my primary care Dr for 5 years I never saw him with a severe medical issue To put it mildly Dr Baraga failed me I will never see him again or refer anyone to him for the way I was terated I went to Dartmouth medical center with severe left calf swelling and moderate pain He suggested a full blood and urine profile I agreed That test came back 100 perfect Next my leg was still swollen and getting worse The pain was umbearable I called Dartmouth for pain relief They said you need an ultrasound this was Saturday I went to Elliott hospital emergency   Got an Ultrasound  No blood clots I went back to Dartmouth Monday saw another Dr In Family practice at Dartmouth He could not figure out was was wrong either He ordered another ultrasound found I had a 6 x1 bakers cist that popped and leaked it's bad fluid into my calf He gave me steroids and non narcotic pain medication I went home took my pills and the swelling went down for the 5 days I had treatment for The day I ran out of medications my leg swelled up and the pain was severe now I called Dr Baraga at Dartmouth for continued treatment they refused I spent another week on the couch because the pain was too great to do anything The next week while still nursing the left leg my right calf blew up swollen like the right leg I made another appointment with Dr Baraga for the right leg He saw me and said you have another problem we need cat scan your heart or liver is probally the problem I pleaded with him that I believed I had another Bakers cist in the right leg He said you want me to believe you have 2 Bakers cists and they both popped about the same time Let me tell you something I have nerver saw a bakers cist in my whole career never mind 2 of them He reluctently sent me to ultrasound It was true I had 2 I was in severe pain unable to walk He did not even ask me how the pain was He gave me water pills for a week This treatment did nothing at all I knew I was going to be in pain for 2 weeks I was not able to walk I called Dartmouth to tell Dr Baraga of my problem He did not care to even call me back I called again the next day still in severe pain I found that taking 4 alleve every 4 hours this would kwell the pain but I was concerned about my stomache I called again he would not give me any pain medication just alltram which I had previously which did not help at all Dr Baraga is the worst Dr I ever have seen to date He has no empathy He doesn't care about his patients and is very arrogant I will never see him again ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I have been experiencing intestinal fatigue gas bloating anxiety and depression for a number of years so I decided to get some blood work done After reviewing my blood work he informed me that everything was okay I started asking him follow up questions at one point attempting to pronounce the name of the microbe that Lyme Disease is named after in hopes that he could confirm it for me He did not take well to this He thought I was trying to educate him and proceeded to role his eyes at me and say  Yeah I know what it is  Sorry doc Didn't mean to insult your ego The rest of the appointment took a downturn as he proceeded to interrupt me at every turn Apparently he is only a nice guy when you don't question his treatment methods He then recommended having me take a CT Scan He didn't bother to inform me of the risks involved with exposure to ionizing radiation After I began informing him of the risks  which is his job  he insisted that I can get the same level of radiation from stepping outside Quackery This doctor doesn't even know the difference between ionizing and non ionizing radiation Do your own research and you will find that CT scans can deliver up to 500 TIMES the ionizing radiation of a chest x ray and should only be used when the benefits out way the risks After informing him that I prefer less invasive and more natural methods of healing he told me that I was wasting my money and that alternative healthcare is a sham despite the fact that naturopathic doctors attend 4 years of medical school the first two being identical to conventional medicine In other words if the treatment doesn't involved a for profit patented synthetic prescription drug  with numerous side effects  then it cannot possibly work This doctor is arrogant He is a professional pill pusher much like many other conventional medical doctors He treats symptoms not underlying problems and will not inform you of the risks It is a shame that he is so quick to throw pills at people without at least considering less invasive methods of treatment such as changes in diet etc Yet his arrogance is merely a bi product of the sick care industry There is a reason why the USA has the HIGHEST  #1  instances of degenerative disease Be your own best advocate if you are going to see any conventional medical doctor And if you do this is not the doctor for you He will not take kindly to being questioned or having his profession/credentials evaluated ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I have had several ofice visits with Dr Braga and I have found that he gives detailed explanations for the treatment that he is prescribing or as follow up to other doctors treatment  example in the hospital  I first encountered him when our primary physician was out due to illness For one thing I was impressed by his professional appearance It was a respect for his profession Out doctor had to leave the practice and as my first choice i chose to stay with Dr Braga Outher memebers of my family moved to other doctors in the D H unit I will stay with Dr Braga as long as he contiues to be my doctor of choice ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I brought my son in  6 years old  as a new patient and after seeing him and his staff at work I wouldn't bring a pet rat to see him We waited in the waiting room for 40 minutes and when we were taken in the Medical Assistant did not apologize for our wait and was rude After going in the patient room my son was see by a student and Dr Braga did not even come in the room to introduce himself or his student The student thought my son's ear looked red and possibly infected so he said the Dr would be in to take a look 15 minutes later Dr Braga storms in the room fast and rude he didn't introduce himself and he didn't apologize for the wait He roughly said to my son let me take a look at your ear because the student said its infected He took a look and said there was wax so he took a plastic hook and dug deep pushing into my sons ear causing him pain and him to cry He then said well its hard to see but I think its infected in one area He then got on his lap top and had to research the amount of antibiotic to give him in which he gave my son a very high dose He was quick and rude when leaving and said come back if he gets worse and left I went to patient orientation to report him right away and switch to pediatrics immediatly It is two days later and I had to bring my son back in because he is not feeling better The pediatrics NP said that he does have conjuctivitis but there is no sign of an ear infection at all So Dr Braga gave my son an antibiotic  high does  that he never needed Never go to him He is not a perfessional Dr his staff is rude and he should never see children ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_M_Furey html, Christopher M Furey ,Dr Furey is great he always takes his time and addresses every concern I have and has always gone above and beyond His receptionist is the reason for the low review She is extremely rude and speaks to patients like they are dumb May be time to look elsewhere ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_M_Furey html, Christopher M Furey ,I started with the Primary Medical Group with a different doctor who eventually moved out of state The facility was nice and the doctor was very good After she moved Dr Fury took over as my doctor He's young and can be very thorough and easy to talk to but since the practice moved to the new facility at Kent Hospital it has become much too busy and I feel that the doctor is overwhelmed I'm also not a fan of a couple of the office staff members as they can be a bit too brusque for my taste I'm now feeling it may be time to move on ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_M_Furey html, Christopher M Furey ,Not impressed In severe back pain for over 1 month Reviewed MRI said surgery was not an option  which I understood  Gave no reference for physical therapy just told me to find an exercise I liked and get through the pain ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Lebo html, Christopher M Lebo ,when you go for a physical i think theres more to it then checking your blood pressure and doing lab work ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Lebo html, Christopher M Lebo ,The most amazing thing about Dr Lebo is his efficiency Wait times are virtually non existant I can show up have a physical get blood work done and be out in literally less than 20 minutes I've been to fast food restaurants with less speed His nursing staff are all courteous and helpful on the phone too He is really the perfect primary care doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Klaus html, Christopher R Klaus ,A Great doctor knows what he's doing ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Klaus html, Christopher R Klaus ,Intellectually incurious Sloppy Condescending Almost half a year in to treatment I had to insist he send me to a specialist which has resulted in an 8 month delay to my care Told me he just didn't understand why I was in so much pain despite clear documentation of a severe spine problem with nerve damage blood markers showing ongoing inflammation and multiple other medical issues Just reviewed my chart and despite me giving him my records from previous doctors the medical problem list is incomplete Dr Klaus needs to spend more time learning about the real world challenges people in pain face rather than being so dismissive Not impressed at all ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Klaus html, Christopher R Klaus ,Been seeing him for about 5 months now and he is very condescending and spends less than 10 minutes with me on every visit even on a so called physical I have to do all of the leg work myself as far as referrals are concerned And none of my symptoms are any better ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Concetta_Oteri-Ahmadpour html, Concetta R Oteri-Ahmadpour ,She was my previous doctor and due to transportation and cancellation I unfortunately had to be terminated from her practice Not only is this doctor extremely wise in her field of providing Osteopathic service in which healed me so I did not have to rely on other doctors and medication but she handled every matter at hand better than any other doctor I trust her judgement 100 and she was the most thorough doctor If there is something wrong she will take the appropriate step to find out quickly She does not only care for the money but for the people She fixed my back and neck She will not prescribe a medication unless she has a full knowledge of the patient and the medication This woman is who I would pick for immediate attention on every matter and I would put my own father's life  minister  in her hands if I had the opportunity if he were still living ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Concetta_Oteri-Ahmadpour html, Concetta R Oteri-Ahmadpour ,We absolutely LOVE Dr Oteri She was able to diagnose me when others failed and actually listens to her patients and their needs I have been to other Doctors and have been treated like crap by them ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Concetta_Oteri-Ahmadpour html, Concetta R Oteri-Ahmadpour ,I've watched her destroy a family and not even blink She has relationships with patients and I know one couple she was with both of them and they divorced because of her She was with both of them husband and wife Yes these were patients People ask questions everyone knows this happened Now she's hiding her income to screw over her ex and her boyfriend's ex no caring about all the kids involved Why do you think she doesn't have custody of her own She left hers for weeks to leave her husband and move in with her boyfriend and girlfriend who were patients She works 12 hours a week total and never returns phone calls or emails Her voice mail is always full If my life depended on her I'd be dead She lost her board certification got suspended and pretended it was a vacation When she lied about my having an appointment after I drove all the way there I realized it was over She only cares about herself and I'm not willing to stay quiet anymore ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Corey_Gittleman html, Corey W Gittleman ,I would never refer a friend to this doctor unless I secretly hated them It is noted that on a WebMD com review that he treats Bipolar Disorder and this is NOT THE CASE I have been on the same medication for years to manage my symptoms and he would refuse to refill certain ones His bedside manner leaves much to de desired as well ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,I've been going to Dr Gustafson for at least 10 yrs I am in the medical field so I was cautious about making sure my doctor was knowledgeable and that he is  He's down to earth and caring  he doesn't rush out of the room he takes time to answer my questions ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,This review is based off my initial consultation with Dr Gustafson and his team I have personally been on the hunt for a more personable PCM with a focus on bedside manner and competency In the past year I have had three PCM's which none fit the bill nor met the requirements I looked for in a PCM I cannot say that is the case with Dr Gustafson and his team From entering and checking in to the consultation itself I couldn't have felt more comfortable I have faith this patient/doctor/medical team relationship will continue to meet my every expectation ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Needs to adopt the medical profile system on the web so he can update a patient's profile ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Needs to adopt the medical profile system on the web so he can update a patient's profile ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Unfortunately this is the worst doctor I have ever had the displeasure of meeting It seems as though he cannot wait to get you out of his office After I asked him a question he behaved as if I had not right to do so He doesn't seem to know anything except the most basic aspects of treatment I really think he might be suffering from some kind of mental degeneration He couldn't have always been this ill informed Please do yourself a favor and avoid this quack ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Have been going to him for a little over 15 years  twice in that time he has diagnosed me with a condition that required a specialist followup and he was spot on both times Pays attention to my input as well i'm a little surprised at the negative feedback on the office staff i've always had good experiences with them ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Dr G has been my doctor for 16 years He has treated me for various problems He will go over and above to help with a problem When other Speciality doctors were of no help Dr G was always there His office Staff always treats me with kindness and respect I would recommend him to anyone ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Dr Gustafason should not be allowed to see patients anymore Read about his terrible malpractice by googling it You won't dare having him diagnose anything for you afterwards ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Believe the bad reviews This guy is truly awful His attitude and lack of follow up are the most apparent but after just a few visits you begin to see his medical skill set is also far below par You deserve better Find a good doctor you can trust to care for your family's health ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,He is a good doctor The staff that books the appointments and gets you checked in are pretty much useless ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,I've been with him for about 5 years and he's been pretty good His staff is another matter They are generally rude and don't quite seem to know whether they're coming or going Be prepared to wait ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Dr Gustafson is really the worst doctor I have ever met There really is no other way to put it I am 67 years old and have had my share of doctors I recently moved to Harvard MA and ignored the other poor reviews because he was close to where I live That was a big mistake Dr Gustafson's condescending attitude is used to mask is poor medical skills The reviews here on Vitals are a great resource But if you ignore them like I did they can't help I will always check this website first and use it as a guide to find the right doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Been going for 10 years Great Doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,If you are trying to find a new doctor in the area as I was this one might not be who you are looking for At least not if you expect to see him in 20 minutes or so I waited over an over an hour because he over books his patients Then his poor evaluation of my condition really made me question his abilities He failed to even look at the records my previous doctor sent to his office Because of this he misdiagnosed my condition Fortunately I knew he was wrong and asked if he read my records Nope Well that was it I'll let him go back to whatever he thought was more important than getting up to speed on a new patient Through this site I found a highly rated doctor and I am so glad I did ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Very knowledgeable and caring He is a very good Doctor Kudos to him,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Between the time this guy takes off from work  almost never sees patients after lunch  and his poor bedside manner you will wonder how anybody still sees him His whole office shut down for an hour and a half for lunch in which nothing is done so plan on that as well He is the type who makes you feel that he is doing you a favor by just talking to you He talks over you as if he doesn't hear you This is particularity obvious when you question something he has done Bottom line there are just too many good doctors out there to bother with this louse ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,This doctor has been a complete disappointment in every way possible You and your family deserve better than this guy ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Didn't even check my blood pressure Barely spoke to me before rushing me out ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Dr G takes as much time as is necessary to deal with my medical issues He cares about the total person Not just the physical problems I have He follows up to find out how I'm doing I appreciate the balance between care and the objectivity he brings to my issues ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,He has been my doc for over ten years He will be there for you when you need him He has stood by me when I was sick and had no help other than him He is very collaborative and will listen to you I don't agree with any negative reviews He is a very compassionate doctor that will listen to your opinion His partner is also very good and the office team is excellent I have watched his staff evolve over a decade into a great team ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,I switched to the office a few months ago and couldn't be happier Dr Gustafson is great and the rest of his staff especially his nurse practitioner Rebecca is equally good ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Great Doctor very caring and honest Great staff ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Dr G listens lets you be a partner in your health He is a straight shooter and not a minion for canned protocols and diagnoses Several of my friends go there and feel the same about him Anyone who doesnt give him a good rating is probably unable to engage in the intelligent interaction he offers ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,On two seperate occasions I tried to get an appointment with Dr Gustafson  who was my primary care doctor at the time and was told he would not see me because he was leaving early that day The first time came when I suffered a head injury I called around noon and was informed that he was leaving early that day so he wouldn't see me even though I was able to come over right away Instead I had to go to the emergency room and pay a lot more money for the same diagnosis he could have given me which was a broken orbital and a mild concussion On the next occassion I called around noon because I had an infection that I needed a prescription for I received a call back three hours later with instructions to see someone else the next day because Dr Gustafson was leaving early Needless to say Dr Gustafson is no longer my primary care doctor and I would not recommend him to anyone ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Dr Gustafson has been by pcp for 10 years outstanding,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Finding the right doctor for you is a very personal thing I found the right one for me in Dr Gustafson He genuintely cares about my well being and in the eight years I have been seeing him I have found nothing to complain about He and his staff are professional and pleasant I'm sorry to hear a few others have had bad experineces I have had many doctors in my lifetime and he ranks right up there with the best of them ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,Very rude to his staff and my husband Was in a rush even though he made us wait over 45 ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Craig_S_Gustafson html, Craig S Gustafson Jr ,a bit odd ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Cynthia_Horner html, Cynthia P Horner ,In 2000 she diagnosed me with CFS a rare but difficult illness to recognize and treat This was after relentless tests at my request b/x a parnter at the practice had diagnosed depression and meds were NOT helping She listened whe others just guessed was compassionate and deduced exactly what was happening during a very scary time for me You won't find another like her Wishe she was closer ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Cynthia_Horner html, Cynthia P Horner ,Dr Horner was amazing She answered my ton of questions and was really helpful and patient and friendly I've been recommending her to all my friends The one downside is that the office staff although friendly when you see them consistently screw up things like calling in refills and giving timely test result information ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Cynthia_Tolbert html, Cynthia R Tolbert ,I am so fortunate to have found Dr Tolbert at a time when my insurance had to change Shed he best ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Cynthia_Tolbert html, Cynthia R Tolbert ,Recently in Sept I became ill do to lack of urgency of my doctor Cynthia Tolbert I had to go the emergency room I received a shot of antibiotics 2 weeks later still not well I actually got an appointment at her office When seen by her I had 2 ear infections and was given a prescription for what is called a z pack After about one week I was back in the office and seen by her Nurse Practitioner At this time she said it is allergies so did nothing Still ill I went to the emergency room once again and was given another antibiotic No matter the order of this I later returned to the doctors office When I went back in a week or so later Still had an ear infection was given a script for another antibiotic 10 days I was on this Still another time I returned to the doctor and still had an ear infection This time I was a little upset and was finally given a referral to a specialist When the doctor there ordered car scans Returning 2 days later found I had a severe ear infection and needed a tube put in my ear Yet another mind you 21 days of antibiotics Do to Doctor Tolbert nurse practitioner and other obvious lack of attention to this ear infection I feel this is not acceptable When I have had emergency illnesses I can't even get an appointment and by the time I would have one become so ill I am forced to go the the emergency room I lost many days of work from this and could have possibly lost my hearing or damaged my ears Mind you I have been a patient of hers for almost 10 yrs On that note I also have 2 herniated disk and getting a pain med is like pulling teeth Is this a lack of concern or a lack of medical training ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Cynthia_Sprague html," Cynthia Sprague, ",Very special Doctor that is very caring and kind Takes her time with you and is very knowledgeable kind Never harsh nor condescending nor uppity Very easy to speak with and follows up Dr Cindy is terrific Would have no doubt about recommending to anyone  ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Cynthia_Sprague html," Cynthia Sprague, ",cynthia sprague has been there through thick & thin She is an exceptional doctor and has saved me in many situations i have never encountered a doctor that is so compassionate to patients needs,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Dana_Zweig html, Dana F Zweig ,She would only make early morning appointments on Fridays even though I told her multiple times that I had university classes that day in Cambridge I would have to cut class and ride an hour home that thursday only to have to book it back to school right after She was completely oblivious to my mental health needs and I would have to spend a half hour explaining to her how they affect me This was especially difficult since I went to her for my depression and anxiety in the First Place She was insistently cruel to me about my weight and the only thing that prevented her from saying anything was having my mother in the room with me I remember my second appointment with her when I told her that the medication she prescribed me was causing me to miss meals  in context I hadn't eaten a full meal in over four days cause the medication was affecting my anxiety  and in response she told me that that was great news because I had already lost five pounds in two weeks and proceeded to up the dosage I keep thinking back to that  That if I was a preteen who didn't know any better she could have inadvertently started an eating disorder The last straw was when she sprung on me that she was going to do a pap swear during my exam and my immediate thought was no no no anyone but her Every time I have to go into that office I have a complete emotional breakdown resulting in me crying and begging not to go in After my last appointment I will no longer be seeing her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Dana_Zweig html, Dana F Zweig ,if you are ill and need an appointment relatively soon don't go here closed on weekends Thursday and most of Wednesday no one is ever in the office to take calls in person and the refusal to write prescriptions when needed is frustrating attention to detail is non existent ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Dana_Zweig html, Dana F Zweig ,I was a patient of Dr Z's for several years with good results and good rapport and remained with her after I'd moved 50 miles from her office I did switch to a local  5 minutes from my house  clinic with numerous clinicians who have only managed to make me sick and mismanage my care due to their scatter shot approach The only reason I switched from Dr Z was convenience and I definitely want to switch back to her which I'm hoping to do this week I found Dr Z to be thoughtful deliberate and very professional ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Dana_Zweig html, Dana F Zweig ,I've had her as a primary doctor for over 3 years and I couldn't wait to switch to a different doctor She was never friendly Made me wait few times taking other patients ahead of me At times was rude The top of the iceberg was when she asked me to see her for a follow up on a medicine she prescribed only that she never sent the prescription to the pharmacy She sent a blood test order after I told her I didn't want it and I wouldn't go and somehow I got billed for it anyway She never did anything about a referral to another doctor regarding physical and reading results on a biopsy  for possibly cancer  Very very disappointed with her services Also front end staff is never friendly Last time I went to ask for my medical record I remembered why I was switching to a different primary doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Dana_Zweig html, Dana F Zweig ,Uncaring attitude needs to reffer to book most of the time to try to make diagnosis Incompetent Arrogant: likes to give unsolicited advices does not listen to concerns Does not explain medical condition She only cares how to boot as many clients out of the door to get as much profit as possible She bruised my cervix during pap smear and then office lost the pap results ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniel_Veno html, Daniel A Veno ,I was a client of dr Veno's for many years he is a great doctor so helpful I moved to NH and had to leave him as my pcp many years back It took me years to find a doctor of his standard I would highly recommend him to my friends and family Dr veno helped me through a major chronic illness I have since I was a teenager Even when I left his practice I made an appointment with doctor veno to vouch for me to a plastic surgeon after a major surgery for medication needed I will never forget the outstanding care I received by dr veno ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniel_Veno html, Daniel A Veno ,Always a gentleman very welcoming so patients are relaxed many years of experience we think alike on many subjects helped me a great deal when in a cancer battle many years ago He is a very smart doctor in diagnosing medical issues with his patients ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniel_Veno html, Daniel A Veno ,I'm a young woman full time worker wife and mother I don't have time to be sick or in pain Dr Veno acts like you should be ashamed if you ask for prescriptions and I'm talking cough medicine to much It is extremly expensive to get your records transferred I wish I had transferred sooner instead of trying to find a new doctor while being sick He also always makes you wait at least 30 45 minutes in the exam room ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniel_Shreve html, Daniel T Shreve ,First time seeing this Dr I was surprised with his lack of caring He never introduced him self And I felt that my concerns were not heard I will not see him again ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniel_Shreve html, Daniel T Shreve ,Dr Steve is an excellent doctor He is extremely knowledgeable and a excellent office staff He sounds grumpy but on the inside he is a teddy bear He reminds me of the program House the doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniel_Shreve html, Daniel T Shreve ,This is my husbands doctor for years I went to him briefly until I realized how poor the care was I have rosecea that he claimed he could treat The cream he prescribed caused the skin to peel off my face I asked to be referred to a dermatologist and he said he could treat it I did not need a referral That is when I left The dermatologist I saw said she had no idea why he would have prescribed that cream for my face My husband has been going there for years and will never learn his lesson He needed a refill on a blood pressure prescription and I knew he would run out before his upcoming appt I called his office on Friday morning and was told have the pharmacy call and they would refill it On Sunday I went to pick it up and the pharmacy said they had called his office but he had not returned the call They said they would call again Monday morning Monday night I went to pick up the meds again and they said they had called again and he still was not returning their call I called the answering service and told them that my husband was out of pills and has high blood pressure and needed his pills they said he would not fill it after hours I told her that they would not fill it during business hours either since the pharmacy had already tried to fill it twice They called him at home and I was told he said it can wait till tomorrow I told them that without his pills my husband is at risk for a stroke and could they call him again and let him know because it does not seem fair we a being punished for his inability to fill the scripts when his office assured me they would They said they called again and told him and that he was not going to take the time to call it in it would have to wait This is not the first time we have had problems with getting this medication refilled I just hope my husband has the good sense to leave this Dr too ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,really care and see the same provider each time,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,Dr Verani always takes the time to delve further into the causes of the symptoms and will schedule tests to get to the bottom of it She is an advocate for you even getting in touch with the insurance company on behalf She has a calming quiet way about her Would recommend her to anyone who wants a caring doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,Dr Verani has been my doctor for over 20 years I find her helpful informative knowledgeable and never feel rushed ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,worste Doctor ever she shouldn't even see patients,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,Conscientious and caring and efficient ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,I was expecting a meet and greet because I'm looking into new doctors but apparently was scheduled for multiple procedures that I didn't ask for When I refused to allow her to preform one of these she tried scare tactics and gulit tripping me into the unnecessary procedure which I continued to refuse Her idea of a physical exam was to get my height and weight but barely put her hands on me aside from shaking my hand She didn't have me remove any clothing at all and ordered blood tests but didn't have a specific lab for me to go to I will not be going back to this doctor and would never recommend her to anyone ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,I feel Dr Verani is a little old school in her treatment options Don't feel I received a thorough physical during my last visit she seemed to rush through it ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,I have been looking for a Dr who is as carring as Dr Verani and her staff for the past 10 years I was shocked by the level of care I received The office staff followed up with me to notifiy me of test results and even to check to see if the medications I had been prescribed were working It is so nice to not feel like one of the herd just being shuffled along I will be reccomending her to all of my family and friends ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,She has a horrible office staff They repeatedly call to make appointments even though I do not need to be seen She sends certified harrssing letters if yu do't schedule an appointment for a physical STAY AWAY FROM HER OFFICE BAD EXPERIENCE Previous t my last encounter she constantly referred me to other doctors for very simple issues She just wants the insurance money and then passes the buck AWFUL ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,Im a fifty years old and have not gone to the Doctor in years Recently I was referred to Dr Verani from a friend Thanks to my friend I found and physican and office that I can call anytime I have questions I can be seen all most every time with in the day or next day Hardly a wait Very friendly Staff D,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,DO NOT GO HERE She is very rude and not friendly at all She has never said one nice thing to me You will wait 40 mins for a appt but if your late two mins they will not take you ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,Office hours are restrictive and the office policies seem designed to generate revenue I was a patient there for 15 years and although I have no problems with the MEDICAL care the staff has a VERY high turnover making it difficult for them to schedule and keep appointments Essentially the only guaranteed provider in the office is Dr Verani but the practice has too many patients for there to be just one provider on site Interestingly if you search on Daniela Verani online most of the results will be in Help Wanted postings On several occasions my scheduled appointments were cancelled due to a CNP or PA having left the practice and on more than one occasion a new appointment was rescheduled without my knowledge I was then notified that I had missed my new appointment and that I owed them for the missed date I knew nothing about The staff would also not call in a prescription to the local pharmacy for my child's strep throat  so that I could pick it up on the way home instead of having to wait with a weepy vomiting feverish 3 year old  Although their indifference went unchanged we were able to express our unhappiness with this situation with a stomachful in the waiting room which seemed quite fitting They also do not offer any phlebotomy services onsite which requires you to get a referral for routine blood work There are now many more convenient options in the area and I would recommend looking into them ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,i have heard some negative stories about this physician many times but decided to try her anyway because of the convenient location big mistake i saw her on 3 different occasions regarding pain in my lower back and a general ill feeling that was getting progressively worse Each time I was simply told it was sciatica and that nothing could be done but stretching as often as possible 2 months ago the pain landed me in cmc hospital where they did an mri and found a spinal abcess if it had been diagnosed the first time i had seen Dr Verani I would not be sitting in a wheelchair right now The ER surgeons could not understand how something so easy to spot was missed So because of a convenient location I will never walk again ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,doctor is great staff turnover is very high Messages don't always get to dr ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Daniela_Verani html, Daniela E Verani ,Absolutely terrible Bedside manners go out the door with this lady I'm surprised she doesn't spit on the floor How can she stay in business with her attitude ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Darcy_Thomas html, Darcy G Thomas ,I have been seeing Darcy for close to three years Before finding her I had chronic neck and back pain that often turned into migraines leading to missed work/low quality of life I have not had a migraine since starting with Darcy and my pain and quality of life have improved She also treated me during my pregnancy which was a life saver as my back and hips were often in pain Darcy is professional kind and caring I feel lucky to have found her ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Darcy_Thomas html, Darcy G Thomas ,I have been seeing Dr Thomas for 7 8 years She has been my most important medical provider throughout complicated medical concerns And I attribute much of my improved health to her care My primary care doctors have always labeled my visits as complicated care  But Dr Thomas has been a different experience She has helped me become in tune to my body's needs and listens as I describe the symptoms I am experiencing She has made time for me for emergency appointments when a symptom was severe I don't have the words to explain how her treatment works but I do know that I feel different and better after my visits I feel like my body is working WITH me instead of AGAINST me with her care For example for 15 years I experienced complicated digestive problems Dr Thomas has been a crucial part of figuring out solutions and resetting my body and has been far more effective than my GI doctors or endocrinologists at implementing long term solutions I have experienced migraines and headaches for 30 years but both are dramatically less with Dr Thomas' care And as the symptoms or headaches occur Dr Thomas' continued treatments have minimized the duration and intensity I have sent many friends to Dr Thomas knowing that they would experience thoughtful and thorough treatment from a kind and wise practitioner I can't recommend Dr Thomas enough but then again maybe I don't want everyone else to fill up her appointment spots : ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Darcy_Thomas html, Darcy G Thomas ,Not sure if the previous poster was reviewing the right doctor but Darcy has been treating my back pain for the past 18 months Her treatments are the only thing that has kept me medication free in years Her work is nothing short of magical and her disposition is knowledgeable nurturing and calming To have an osteopath take insurance is rare and to find one with so much experience is even rarer I'm grateful for her work everyday ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Darcy_Thomas html, Darcy G Thomas ,Difficult to measure how helpful she was because she presents herself as not being very stable ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Gilchrist html, David B Gilchrist ,I am been seeing Dr Gilchrist since he became a Dr He is a great diagnostician  kind man caring and responsive ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Coia html, David J Coia ,I've never experienced anything like what the negative reviews have said Never has he come in eating or run from the room laughing like a lunatic I find him to be a good doctor and very thorough The nurse will take my vitals and if they seem off he will double check them My problem is I can't locate him again He left the office in Cumberland then resurfaced in Johnston Now he's no longer in Johnston I have medical issues that require monitoring and would prefer to stay with him The office in Johnston he was in is terrible but I dealt with them to see him Now I have to deal with them for med maintenance until I can get with a new PCP or find Dr C ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Coia html, David J Coia ,Always wait for at least 1 5 hours in the lobby What is the point of making appointment Not a good family doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Coia html, David J Coia ,Went in for my annual physical and he didn't even check my blood pressure Wacks my knees with what appeared to be a regular sized hammer and then he starts laughing like a lunatic I said what the heck is wrong with you and he runs out of the room laughing I honestly think he was high on something to behave like this I may take legal action if he hurt my knees ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Coia html, David J Coia ,This guy is out there and very rude Waited in a cold room for almost an hour before he decides to come in eating candy and licking his fingers Disgusting to say the least He then asked me Why are you here in a very creepy way not even looking at me while he continued to eat He was making little noises and humming I found his behavior very immature disgusting and arrogant All I was thinking about was leaving I do not recommend this so called Dr to anyone ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Coia html, David J Coia ,Dr is very strange When I asked him about my current medications he just stared at me and smiled saying nothing He seemed very distant and uncaring making me feel uncomfortably At times he would talk to himself mumbling Not professional at all Will not be going back ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Spiegelman html, David M Spiegelman ,Wait time can vary depending on emergencies other patients' conditions and the seriousness of certain patients at the time Dr Spiegelman tries to be on time and he has always allowed time for me to explain meds or my condition He's never missed a diagnosis makes a phone call to explain things  if asked  and follows up He is not a pill pusher and rarely writes a prescription any more because prescriptions are now texted to a pharmacy That saves abuse He's been my doctor for 30 years and advises me on top specialists ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_David_Spiegelman html, David M Spiegelman ,Very abrupt in taking history poor bedside manner and way too hasty to pull out the prescription pad Office staff was very weak in handling referrals I changed PCP and am now with a Doctor who is far better ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Debby_Almeida html, Debby M Almeida ,I agree with the previous reviewer I have been a patient of this physician for many years and think she is a great doctor Very friendly and takes the time to listen to you Not a fan of the secretary who I find to be rude and just overall not friendly at all Have scheduled appointments 6 months in advanced only to get a call the month prior to tell me I no called no showed and when I was going to reschedule When I really did not Then given an attitude My last appointments I have seen the NPs which is fine but I would look like to see the doctor and have been told I need to see the NPs by the secretary Haven't seen Dr Almeida in over 2 years Considering switching physicians because of this ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Debby_Almeida html, Debby M Almeida ,Her staff is rude disrespectful and scheduling to see the doctor herself is horrible Her secretary is not friendly she dictates to the patient she lies about treatments and referrals The doctor is good but not worth see due to her staff When you complain about how her staff or secretary treats you she defends there wrong If you know that your staff is doing something wrong and you have different ratings online complaining about it than you need to reevaluate your staff WHAT EVERYONE IS REFERRING TO IS YOUR SECRETARY MARIA SHE IS VERY VERY RUDE AND LIES A LOT ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,Long story short Dr Amirtham did not listen to my concerns and will end up costing me thousands of dollars for her lack of professionalism and competence She sent me for TWO MRIs that have shown nothing related to the pain I am experiencing and she has referred me to two other specialists One who doesn't understand why I was there in the first place but has scheduled tests to satisfy Dr Amirtham's concerns and then another specialist that will end up sending me for another MRI because the part of my body causing the pain was not scanned previously even though Dr Amirtham knew I had existing issues She is extremely rude and not empathetic at all I lost my dad last year and went into a deep depression She was quick to offer me anti depressant medication but when I asked for a referral to a psychologist or therapist she told me to go to the Psychology Today website Unbelievable ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,I had an awful experience with Deborah Amirtham She made me cry while doing pap smear test as if it was her first time doing it She made me do one similar test 3 times and deceiving me that all of the tests will be covered by insurance She said the reason I am asking you to redo the test is that I don't trust Labarotory results Not only I didn't get any follow up call about the the test results but also I was charged two times I called her 3 times to talk to her and left her messages but She never get back to me ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,I only saw Dr Amirtham twice During both occurrences she wore a mask on her face and said it was a precaution She would not tell me what precaution I had no communicable diseases Through out my med check appointment she was very disrespectful towards me and treated me like a child I understand that some mental illnesses can hinder one's cognative ability however I do not have such illnesses I am a functioning adult that works 40+ hours a week I was very distraught after the second appointment when I tried to have her look at a spot on my breast It was extremely painful She then had one look and proceeded to put a bandaid with neosporin on it because I'm too young to have those scars  Quite frankly that is an insult to me and my history and my whole body is covered in scarring I do not recommend any individual to see this woman ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,Presumptive dismissive and felt she was more interested in routine responses than finding out concerns,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,Cancelled meds I have been on for years with no consultation or care for my needs,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,i have to agree with the prior review she is abrupt and condescending interrupts and seems impatient for you to finish She changed all my maintenance meds that i'd been on for years to things that didnt work at all then refused change the prescription when i called to say they werent working I will have to look for another doctor that will listen ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Meesarapu html, Deborah N Amirtham ,Although I only saw her once her action were deplorable Not only did I not feel cared for I felt that she was condescending and judgmental I have always praised every experience I have had with DH and unfortunately Dr Meesarapu was AWFUL She not only made me feel small she mis diagnosed me and put my health at risk I will also be lodging a formal complaint with DH and the Medical board DO NOT SEE THIS DOCTOR,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Dennis html, Deborah T Dennis ,After waiting for more than an hour in the waiting room and no apologies she didn't seem interested in what I was going through and insisted on tests that I clearly didn't need After two days I had to call the office twice to get a result on the tests for which I was waiting for while my condition getting worse by the day and was told by a nurse that complete results are not in and still she went on to give me a prescription with a half baked explanation about my real problem No one ever called me with results After week and half I got a negative report in mail for something that I had mentioned to the doctor I do not need but she still insisted on doing And a few weeks later I got a huge bill of over $300 00 from the office because apparently my insurance does not cover the test she insisted on  I'm looking for a new doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Dennis html, Deborah T Dennis ,First impressions of Dr Dennis were good She came across as knowledgeable & caring but that did not last After seeing her for chronic headaches back pain and insomnia I was sent for rounds of testing specialists and medications Most of my follow up visits were with other doctors in the group since waiting 3 or more weeks for an appointment with Dr Dennis is not an option when you are in pain and/or having a reaction to the prescribed medication Once the test results came back fine I was told there was nothing more that could be done for me since I didnt want to continue to deal with the side effects of the medications I would just have to deal with the pain She was very dismissive and not interested in even discussing treatment options I had found through my own research That was my last visit ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Dennis html, Deborah T Dennis ,I have been a patient of Dr dennis for some time now I am an asthmatic and without her finding the proper inhaler for me I would still be having major issues I have been an asthmatic since I was 11 months old I am now 46 and not once have I been able to not carry a rescue inhaler until finding the right Dr She is professional caring understanding and takes time with me at every appointment I would highly reccomend Dr Dennis to family and friends ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Deborah_Dennis html, Deborah T Dennis ,she is quite simply not a good diagnostician patients love her but the nurses know better than to go to her she makes mega mistakes but covers them well Ask a nurse who the best docs are DD isn't one of them ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Diane_Dubois-Hall html, Diane I Dubois-Hall ,have been a patient with her for over 15 years All the things I have read about her on ratings are not true I have never had a problem with her and neither has my entire family all 7 of us People need to understand doctors and there time management She has been great with all of us ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Diane_Dubois-Hall html, Diane I Dubois-Hall ,My parent recently went in to get a RX renew office girl said they would call parent rather than allow parent to wait and get RX as parent had the time to wait and understood doc was with a patient or perhaps could be a call in to pharmacy As being a nurse that ran offices myself I advised parent to leave this office as it is now late and no RX called in or given to my parent Parent very upset and hypertensive No excuse for poor service on such a simple request ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Diane_Dubois-Hall html, Diane I Dubois-Hall ,I went to Urgent care on rt44 & was diag with mersa they gave me one antibiotic and then after testing found it wouldnt be effective so Dr Dubois Hall  who never saw me  prescribed clindamycin w/o speaking to me I trusted the urgant care and took it when I finally got to another doctor and they said the dose i was takin was 3x the amount needed I was getting sick so I stopped taking it I went to a specialist since I have colitis between these two doctors I found out that Clindamycin shouldnt be given to people in my condition and causes severe damage even death And yes there is no proof antibiotics help Mersa so this med was not an imediate need much less 3x the dose I have been sick for over 3 months and out of work It has been an awful awdeal and I have even had internal bleeding Had Dr Dubois Hall actually took a minute to read my file she would have seen that by giving me that drug she was gambling with my life She will not even get a mark on her record for doing this I find it amazing that a child in a sweat shop will mess up a sweater and lose their hand  this is just to show the extreme I dont agree with sweat shops  but a doctor who makes hundreds of thousans and takes an oath to protect patients can get away with this with out even a record of it DONT LET YOUR LIFE BE THE NEXT GAMBLE OF DR DUBOIS HALL ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Edward_P_Butler html, Edward P Butler ,The worse medical experience I have ever had On first appointment this Doctor poked me in the stomach laughing and said You thought that you would never get this virus ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Edward_P_Butler html, Edward P Butler ,Doctor Butler was exceptionally cordial compassionate and very informative during my visit He spent time to explain his diagnosis and took time to provide written information to supplement his discussion He was friendly direct and patient to ensure that we felt comfortable and at ease throughout our visit Overall a very positive and exceptional experience ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Edward_P_Butler html, Edward P Butler ,Extremely rude doctor and staff Went to him for a second opinion for acute Lyme disease Showed him my positive test results from Igenex labs He didn't believe my test and also insulted ilads Doctors stating that they are crazy Very unprofessional ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Edward_P_Butler html, Edward P Butler ,Dr Butler has only confirmed my displeasure for the medical community I was excited to have him as a PCP after seeing his credentials He practices in a hospital that is only 10 30 minutes from Boston but his qualifications would make you think you would get that same care while saving the 10 30 minutes Unfortunately during almost every visit he whisked me out of his office amazingly quick You get the feeling when you leave that he could care less whether you live or die and wonder if he listened to your issue Well eventually I had a serious medical issue and was treated the same He misdiagnosed it and sent me home I later found out that if I hadn't gone back to the ER the next day I would have died within a week Long story short a month after a major surgery he couldn't even remember what happened with me Office staff is great though ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Edward_P_Butler html, Edward P Butler ,Dr Butler saved my life I don't know how else to say it I was at my whits end and seriously considered taking my life and I called him He saw me immediately and put a plan of action together to help me THANK YOU Dr Butler for your knowledge and probably more importantly you caring and compassion ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_E_Katerina_Brodski-Quigley html, Ekaterina K Brodski-Quigley ,Dr Brodski Quigley was extremely rude during my visit at Urgent Care in Burlington Aside from feeling unwelcome I left feeling judged and humiliated I went in with a simple concern and she left me feeling like I had more to worry about than really necessary Instead of getting the facts she asked suggestive questions To young women like myself considering going to this Urgent Care and recieving treatment from Dr Brodski Quigley do not expect a caring or judgment free visit,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Elizabeth_Buchanan html, Elizabeth A Buchanan ,Dr Buchanan and her staff is completely clueless and run a sorry practice After a few visits to treat a confidential problem I realized that I have to explain my situation each time I am the office They have no good record keeping and don't think about you once you leave the office Worse I have to provide her ideas for what could be wrong and to help her consider possibilities It leads me to question her competence The office staff is incompetent as well and regularly bungles insurance paperwork leading to gut wrenching problems getting insurance to take care of the medical bills I would not recommend her to anyone There are more knowledgeable and more able doctors out there if you search a bit ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Elizabeth_Buchanan html, Elizabeth A Buchanan ,My PCP left the area and I thought I woild never find another Dr like him he was a 4 star rating to me I was very lucky and I found a wonderful PCP like Dr Buchanan to take his place Thank You for consenting to be my new PCP You are rated 4 stars across the board like he was ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Elizabeth_Erban html, Elizabeth A Erban ,HORRIBLE STAFF I do not recommend anyone visit Dr Erban Her staff is extremely lazy forgetful and slow They cannot handle sending paper work for blood testing which costs me a couple days of waiting Asking her staff for help in referrals and other important necessities is like asking for an arm and a leg They are very rude Also her hours are horrible She is often taking vacations without letting her patients know If you need medical care  non emergency  good luck booking her I should have switched sooner I have noticed so many dangerous mistakes made by her careless staff I am going to file out a report ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Elizabeth_Alt html, Elizabeth N Alt ,I was a patient of Dr Alt She is a caring and intelligent doctor If you already know what is wrong with you and just want confirmation she may not be the optimal doctor for you However if you experienced trauma i think she will be the best person to see She is patient good listener and will be your advocate if you can not speak up for yourself That is what makes her an excellent service provider I think working with family medicine kids and trauma victims who need an advocate is what she does best ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Elizabeth_Alt html, Elizabeth N Alt ,She has wonderful bed side manners and takes the time to listen to my mothers needs and concerns ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Elizabeth_Alt html, Elizabeth N Alt ,Horrible doctor While her temperament was gental she was useless She has absolutely zero knowledge of womens' health issues and has rational differential reasoning skills She will give you medication and medication is her only go to She gave me completely inappropriate medication then refereed me to an appropriate practioner but for the wrong thing Had she believed I had that particular diagnosis I would have needed a completely different type of procedure and specialist It took me three months before I got an antibiotic They couldn't provide any help I waisted my time and gained stress and anxiety from having to deal with her and her office HORRIBLE ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Emily_Ackerman html, Emily J Ackerman ,Granted I waited a long time to get in with the doctor but when you are in the room with her you have her complete attention It seems that she constantly runs so far behind because of her actually listening to your problems and genuinely wanting to help you The staff was wonderful as well Very pleasant and knowledgeable to speak with ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Emily_Ackerman html, Emily J Ackerman ,You can tell these are old reviews You have to pay me to believe she is a doctor No matter what you go in for she sends you to someone else She will not take the responsibility for anything why are we paying her I ask to be sent to someone else you get a better response from an Urgent care not to say it's over an hour sitting in the waiting room after your appt to get in You talk fast before your dime runs out but then again she's not listening I've been going to her for 2 years hoping things would change the longer your a patient but that never happened shame on me it's time for a new DR the staff is great too bad they work for her More people should start updated their reviews so people will really see what this DR is like with no sugar coating ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Emily_Ackerman html, Emily J Ackerman ,I would never recommend her She is cold and you feel she has a clock ticking while you are there Poor listener I get a necessary prescription out of Canada because it is much cheaper She refused to because I had not been to her office for a year Extortion at its worst What was even more cruel they lied for over three critical weeks that they had sent in the prescription Now I am desperately seeking a new doctor before I get really ill ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Eric_Lupoli html, Eric M Lupoli ,I think this place takes every patient that they can jam into the schedule You are going to be waiting for a long while in the outer room And then bring a book to the examining room because you will be in there alone long enough to read Gone With the Wind ,3,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Farah_D_Khan_1 html, Farah D Khan ,I put into the UMass family clinic on Lincoln Street and was assigned this reprobate as a PCP She lied continuously about the following  She stated that a severe TBI had gotten that spawned a subdural hematomo that nearly cost me my life was cured In addition she stated stated that my hep c was active in total ignorance of the evidence to the contrary in order to stage a painful liver biopsy for the profit of UMass Medical Additionally when asked about a referral for an MRI she stated that MRI imaging entailed subjecting one to unhealthy levels of radiation despite the reality being that the MRI machines operate in the low EMF spectrum and entail NOTHING of the radiation exposure levels that any x ray procedures entail This woman is a highly dangerous reprobate who should be avoided at all cost I wouldn't even give her a single star accept that it required in order to post this review ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,I really liked Dr Baker having switched to him from a previous Primary Care that I did not like He really took time to ask questions and learn about my medical history My one complaint was that he asked some personal questions that I did not feel I needed to answer This made me feel very uncomfortable All in all it was a good experience ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,New to his practice and really haven't been examined Spends all the time on dictation on the computer and you don't know if he's talking to you Maybe searching for another primary care ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,i have been with him for more than 20 years what more can i say,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,After waiting for 55 minutes in the waiting room I then waited for 40 more minutes in the exam room Dr Baker then had the audacity to rush me telling me his time was valuable You know because mine isn't ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,He has poor bedside manner he seemed annoyed by my questions all he talked about was dancing I thought I went to see Fred Astaire instead of Fred Baker ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,Dr was 40 minutes late for appointment He is abrupt and mechanical Made me feel like I was interfering with his routine Kept holding onto examination room doorknob like he wanted to leave while I was asking a few questions Not a pleasant experience Office is cramped rundown and out of date ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,He doesn't care makes you wait forever and once you finally get to see him he rushes you out and will only discuss one issue per visit I have been a patient of his for a long time and will be switching after this last encounter these are just a few of many reasons to stay away do yourself a favor and don't bother with this moron,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,This is my fourth doctor in 60 years I wish they other three had been as caring and knowledgeable as Dr Baker He always asks me many questions about my health and I am never rushed He is very easy to talk to ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,I stayed with this doctor for years due to pure laziness and the fact that I rarely see a doctor When I did have to see him he rarely has time to spend with you If he is really busy he makes you reschedule and when you revisit he has no time to go over any issues you may have I even wrote things down for him and he basically told me he didn't have time He greets you with Hi how are you I'm fine thanks for asking and you haven't said a word He rushes through your visit and sends you on your way The last time he had to call me 1 5 hours after I left his office for something he should have looked at while I was there I fired him on the spot Stay away from this guy ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Frederic_Baker html, Frederic Baker ,Sometimes I feel a little rushed but Dr Baker is thorough and caring He has called me at work to check up on me when I've been sick Overall I am very satisfied with his care ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Hope_Ring html, Hope E Ring ,I arrived as a first time patient to meet the doctor at 8:15 for a 8:30 appointment I previously completed all information through a app on my phone to expedite the check in time Was greeted professionally at the front desk when checking in The doctor assistant who set me up in the room and did my vitals took more medical information was very pleasant and professional When she was finish she said the doctor would be in shortly 41 minutes later and Doctor Ring never came in the room I decided that this was unacceptable   how do you fall behind your schedule at 8:30 in the morning  wasted a morning off from work and wasted time spent filling out info for a quicker check in I guess choosing Doctor Ring was wrong choice ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Hugh_M_Taylor html, Hugh M Taylor ,Dr Taylor's office always offers an appointment time the same or next day  and if I have the flexibility we can get in right away The wait is a bit long but we are always made to feel as if he has all the time in the world with us for questions I have never once felt rushed  hence the wait time  that is the trade off  Dr Taylor listens first then asks follow up questions after that he makes his recommendations On several occasions when being seen by a nurse practitioner if they feel they need his guidance they have gone to speak to him and bring him in for consultation when needed we selected dr taylor after asking around and getting the most positive feedback about him over all other local family practice physicians ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Fieseher html, James G Fieseher ,Doesn't act like he is all mighty and knows everything He was my doctor for a long time when he was in Dover he moved to Portsmouth I tried others in the Dover area didn't care for their perfectness attitude  so I will travel to Portsmouth to see Dr Fieseher I feel like I'm a person not just a patient ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Hoye html, James P Hoye ,Very caring doctor always has time to sit and talk with you about any problems Highly recommend,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Hoye html, James P Hoye ,The patient care is outstanding Dr Hoye is one of the most caring doctors I have come across His entire medical staff is very dedicated and caring individuals On the negative side it is very challenging to get to them over the phone  the phone lines are constantly busy When you do get through you are often times put on hold for what appears to be an eternity I find the administrative staff to be quite rude which is unfortunate ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Hoye html, James P Hoye ,I highly recommend Dr James Hoye He's been my primary care physician for the past 10 years He's knowledgeable and easy to talk with The practice itself offers patients an extremely friendly and clean environment ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Bath html, James S Bath ,Always very thoughtful and thorough ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Bath html, James S Bath ,My family and I are blessed to have Dr Bath as our physician ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Bath html, James S Bath ,Dr James Bath is an excellent doctor Very caring compassionate and listens to his pts He does not rush you at all I would highly recommend him to anyone Also his staff is excellent You are greeted when you walk into the office ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Bath html, James S Bath ,I am new to Dr Bath but the two or three visits that I have had were all excellent He and his staff both are very easy going and down to earth I was never rushed during an appointment and had all my question answered before I left Appointments are usually made with in a day or two sometimes even the same day I would send anyone to this office ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Bath html, James S Bath ,Dr James is warm and compassionate He was great with the two year old his mother and his grandparents ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Pease html, James S Pease ,I really like Dr Pease but I have no choice but to go elsewhere The secretary is AWFUL She is rude and even told me once that Dr Pease is retiring so don't bother making an appointment When I finally got to see the doctor he said that was not true I need a new prescription for blood pressure medication and it took 6 phone calls to get someone to callback The secretary was so rude and said she doesn't have anything to do with getting a new prescription I tried to explain that I needed to go to a new pharmacy and the prescription has to be for 3 months not one She said she can't help with that and I need to call the pharmacy So rude and condescending You are going to lose patients if you don't get rid of your terrible secretary ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Pease html, James S Pease ,Dr Pease treated me for years and one day I learn following an exam that he did not do his job and prescribe me my refill of medications when he told me he did when I was finished with my appointment What did he do he writes me a letter telling me he is retiring really I guess in some ways its best for any others even thinking of seeing this physician I am a women who thinks less of someone that cannot speak to me face to face before you decide what's best for you and write a letter really Don't you realize that when I come to treat with you I may not need my refill that day but maybe in a month or two It's your responsibility to make sure my health is taken care of You bill for your services but you do not provide service in your office when needed It's like when you leave the appointment you treat others like they never even saw you You go and retire and I hope you understand what you have caused people You should be ashamed Do you treat all your patients like this His staff medical secretary is rude has no common sense will not return calls and has no idea the damage she has caused For all other women and men out there who are searching for a physician there are far better providers out there do not waste your time or money ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Pease html, James S Pease ,i have never seen a staff or DR so rude and uncaring my daughter was so sick she called and left a message every day for a week to have the dr call her back she finally had to go to the ER because he NEVER called her back in the past she has tried to get a call back for test results and still NEVER a call back She had an MRI on her head for headaches and was never given the test results this office needs to be shut down before their neglect causes someone serious suffering SHAME ON YOU AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO CALL YOURSELF A DR ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Pease html, James S Pease ,Dr Pease's secretary is awful she is not helpful never follows up on anything does not refill prescriptions when asked to You have to follow up three times before she does anything A medical practice is as good as your team is and she is just awful Calling attorney general on this,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Pease html, James S Pease ,Terrible I was trying pick up my boyfriend who is on crutches so he could get his knee looked at after a football injury as his friend had dropped him off at Dr Pease's for an appointment The doctor used his hands to literally shoo him away like an animal after already allowing him to book an appointment & advertising that He accepts new patients They then refused to let him use their phone to call me forcing him to sit in their office after so rudely dismissing him so I drove around in the snow for 40 minutes trying to find the building because google maps took me elsewhere Greedy greedy Doctor Not a people person Not who you want to go to when you are injured and expect compassion Can't even let a person on crutches use your phone to call for a ride Disgusted honestly ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Pease html, James S Pease ,A co worker recommended Dr Pease I needed a new doctor after relocating I have been to the office three times Once for an intial physical/exam and twice for a sinus infection This is what a doctor's visit should be He makes you feel like a patient and a person I use to dread going to the doctor the wait the scheduling and the hassle I have only waited 5 minutes I have called the morning of and got an afternoon appointment The office secretary is great Never a hassle After a went for my physical he called me a week later to come in and go over my test results Everything was normal but he took the time to explain it I would highly recommend Dr Pease A great doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Schwartz html, James S Schwartz ,I'm not impressed with Dr Schwartz He's quick to toss out diagnoses that aren't always what the actual problem is A mother knows best  so don't be afraid to disagree with any doctor you or your child sees I had to bring my child back twice in order for him to diagnose an ear infection needless to say I wasn't the happiest of parents I'm on the hunt for a more qualified pediatrician in the area ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_James_Schwartz html, James S Schwartz ,Dr Schwartz is an ok doctor His bedside manner leaves a lot of room for growth He needs to work on patience and being less dismissive It appears he really dislikes giving specialist recommendations and will spend and exceeding amount of time attempting to diagnose an issue It appears that frequent repeat appointments are the income of the practice If an appointment runs long I have been told to schedule for another date When calling the office he doesn't speak to patients neither does his PA so you must leave a message She tends to take 3 7 days to return calls IF she returns them The receptionist isn't unfriendly nor a bowl of sunshine however she is efficient ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Janice_Pegels html, Janice J Pegels ,The individualized care I received was so refreshing I felt heard for the first time in a long time I'm thankful for Dr Pegels knowledge and in depth approach and highly recommend seeing her if you've been searching for answers that other doctors have failed to provide ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Janice_Pegels html, Janice J Pegels ,recommended something for me that after researching it myself gave me my first ray of hope of ever feeling better then denied my need for same when writing to the man with the money It was enough to make me give up the man with the money now thinks that I might be lying so have not had funds for ANY treatment all because she decided that item mentioned cost too much Not her money Rather than speak to me about it AT ALL EVER she just went ahead and made a liar out of me That single item would have helped so much  I had told her that I was so looking forward to that relief She has also treated me incorrectly more than once and seems very unsure of what she's doing because she is She has caused me great harm I don't want the same to happen to you ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Janice_Pegels html, Janice J Pegels ,Dr Pegels was rushed and agitated She barely spent any time with me and kept interrupting me I scheduled a 1/2 hour visit and she rushed me out the door in less than 10 minutes I didn't even get to ask her my questions It was awful ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Janice_Pegels html, Janice J Pegels ,Staff is not helpful or caring at all ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jason_Salter html, Jason Salter ,He was my doctor at urgent care I will be making him my primary care physician after today ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,This guy was a trusted family doctor in Rockland County NY Suddenly one day he was gone and so were all of our medical records My children are adopted and any records I had are now gone I contacted his office in Kentucky many times they ignored my requests I said I would even pay for them to mail me mine and my children's records My sons have no records at all he should be ashamed of the way he treated his loyal patients we trusted him and counted on him as our family doctor It's a big mystery as to why he fled Rockland in the dead of the night with no warning Beware of Dr Jay Lorah make copies of all your medical records if you don't you'll be sorry ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,He was my doctor in Kentucky and told me many many months before he would be leaving for another state He was an amazing doctor and i miss him so much I haven't found another doctor like him who I felt comfortable enough to open up to Only wish he would come back closer to me so i could continue having him as my doctor His new patients he has now are very lucky to have him If by chance you read this review Dr Lorah come to ohio I'll be the first one through those doors Such an ol school caring and great listener you are God bless you and your family ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Such a great caring Dr ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,So now he's in Rhode Island He bolted from New York to Kentucky In NY he left without notice leaving many searching for there medical records Other reviews on other site indicate similar problems for his former patients in KY Perhaps he should just be a house doctor at a hospital so when he splits for any other state on his bucket list people won't miss him ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Dr Jay Lorah should be ashamed of himself He is an unethical doctor who deserves to have his medical license revoked permanently He was the family doctor in Rockland County NY for many people In 2013 he left town without a word and left hundreds of patients without access to their medical records Many tried to contact his new office in KY to have their medical records sent to a new doctor without any response or compliance from Dr Lorah or his staff It is disgusting that he would leave so many patients without access to their medical records and ILLEGAL Shame on you Dr Lorah I do not recommend ANY prospective patient see this man ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Any professional is taught that records are crucial That being said holding patients medical records and returning them to their rightful owners is very much a part of the job My medical records were not returned to me after countless requests so I feel for those who needed them more than I did A professional doctor does not leave former patients behind and ignore requests for records regardless of stuff that happened as some have described Obviously Dr Lorah has relocated and has continued his practice elsewhere This tells me he is should be able to do right by his former patients Unfortunately he has chosen not to He had an obligation to his former patients that he most definitely did not fulfill No one is saying that he is a bad person However he most definitely was negligent The fact also that my records are floating around somewhere is not comforting This is the reason for my dissatisfied review ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Amazing listener logical thorough insightful very perceptive knowledgeable in short exceptionally skilled God bless and multiply his time so he may give to others as he has given me and my family ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,So far I have been a patient of his for a year and he is a good man who actually seems to care he has no problem listening I hope he sticks around ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,He listen to his patients He take the time to find out the problem not just put a band aid on it and rush you out REFRESHING With the horrible remarks made by new York People I understand why he might want to have left Office staff is wonderful friendly and very welcoming Highly recommend his and his staff ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Nothing negative to say about dr Lorah except I would lIke a response to my request I sent as per his instructions for my medical records I need my years of medical records and my wife's We sent a letter as per The instructions that was almost 6 months ago ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Nothing negative to say about Dr Lorah I just need our medical records No one will see my daughter without them She needs her 3rd hpv vaccine time is running out cause they have to be given within a time frame I also need my records Please ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,I used to goto Dr Jay Lorah office in pearl river A few months ago it was frustrating going by the office to see that it wasn't open anymore I had no clue what I was supposed to do to get my medical documents Just went by the office last week and the office is open & completely remodeled Looks fantastic There is a new physician there  Dr Noble Jacob  who is extremely friendly and welcoming Apparently he was born and raised in Rockland county and plans on staying He spent time with me asking me about my history and getting to know me better My visit was also very educational I recommend those that got lost in this whole mess with their medical care to head back to that office They have nothing to do w Dr Jay Lorah but will do everything they can to acquire your medical documents ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,As I have stated in my previous review about Dr Jay Lorah I really loved him as my doctor He is fair honest and nice The only issue that I have is that I desperately needed a refill of medication that I have been on 10+ years It is the type of medication where if you stop it it is NOT good It causes HIGH blood pressure  which mine was 150/102 from the withdrawl effect  In an emergency my husband called a physician that he recently started to see to see if they could fit me in so I could get this refill since after three weeks of leaving messages plus a fax today Dr Lorah would not call in the script so I can get by for a month to find a new doctor I am so disappointed that he could not have anyone from his new office call me to tell me that he won't call in the Rx or tell me why he won't No communication at all I even sent a direct fax to the new practice begging for him to call in one last Rx NOTHING Dr Lorah I really liked and respected you but you definitely let me down so much the past three weeks I wish you could have just told me that you could not do it or something I got nothing I did not know you moved at all You were my favorite doctor All I wanted was one month to find a new doctor in my area You know that this drug has horrible withdraw effects that included high blood pressure I am very fortunate that my husband's doctor was able to squeeze me in today I could have been in the ER tonight Now I am feeling so much better after getting my Rx filled I understand that things happen in everyone's life but even my new doctor is shocked that you could not even just call me to tell me that you won't refill my script I wish you all of the happiness in the world I know you had a premature baby in the NICU I have two babies in the NICU myself so it is tough and scary Your former patients needed you and feel very abandoned That is not good business ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,I really liked seeing Dr Jay Lorah in Pearl River NY I used to live in Nanuet I continued to see Dr Lorah for years even after moving to Connecticut He was worth the drive I wish I lived in Kentucky since I would continue to see him He has been very understanding about insurance issues and needs I am shocked that he left without notice  however after reading his responses it was not something he wanted to do or planned to do so I understand I hope you can spend the time with his family ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,I know former patients are upset angry and disappointed but please try to be fair Stuff happens and it appears that Dr Lorah got caught up in a really bad stuff storm I found out quite by accident and was a little taken aback But to say he is a bad doctor who didn't care about his patients is patently unfair and untrue One of the best memories my husband had during the last months of his life  was the time he spent talking with Dr Lorah about life style philosophy He had been a patient for a very short time and was under the direct care of an oncologist but Dr Lorah was always there I was a patient long before my husband was and even though at times I found the office staff exasperating Dr Lorah was ALWAYS available For a comment to be made about his children driving him crazy is irrelevant unkind and untrue Haters love to hate anything they don't understand and for a Dr to put his love of family and a simpler way of life before his professional gains is difficult for many people to wrap their minds around Many of us will miss him but life goes on and I wish him  Mrs Lorah and all the kids nothing but good things ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Dr Lorah is a wonderful and attentive Doctor He is very easy to talk to and you are able to ask the questions that you want to ask and will answer everything without making you feel your concern is unimportant I find him very caring and polite Honest and will tell you what you need to hear instead of what you want to hear I am thankful he has relocated to this area of Kentucky and all of his staff are just as pleasant as he is ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,My family has had Dr Lorah for at least 15 years and he was great for and to us However we were shocked when he was gone w/o notice and his message said someone would still be helping anyone needing it but that never happened The office was shut and closed and he was gone and so too our records We went to the Dr who was supposed to be taking over his practice all the way in Dumont NJ and his people were like what are you talking about It was a mystery to them It was so hard to believe this would happen so quickly and maybe the oncoming of Obamacare drove him away Regardless just a few months notice would have been appreciated as now my wife scrambles to find someone and its a start from scratch situation that is not pleasant We do wish him well he was a good guy and Dr for us BUT his leaving the way he did Thats what the one star was for The rumor is he went to Kentucky If he did God Bless and good luck in a much nicer area I know any move was for the better but we left behind feel kinda screwed To sum it up if he went to Kentucky its their gain and our loss We were hoping to grow old with him ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Very caring Takes the time to discuss your illness with you would highly recommend him We just starting taking are son to him and he loves him Do yourself a favor and let this man treat you Our family lives him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,I switched to Dr Lorah a few years back At first he was great and everyone was so nice the first few visits However that was only the begining I Was sick several times over the winter and out of three visits I never saw him Only his sub par assistant The Receptionist is extremely rude just like others have mentioned I sat on the front couch and waited for 40 min While waiting i listed to her answer the phones and after each call from a patient she had a wise remark to another employee after she hung up the phone Dr Lorah will NEVER return a call either I def would not recomend this office or Dr to ANYONE ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,We have been going to Dr Lorah for many years He is kind thorough and knows his medicine My only comment to new patients would be to schedule a well visit first to establish yourself as a patient because he is so busy it is impossible to get a timely appt if you are sick and not a current patient Definitely would recommend people go to him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,Doctor Lorah saved my father's life He is not about prescribing needless medications but about getting to the root of the problem and finding a solution to whatever it is that brings you to him You deserve care like this Make an appt with the best doctor in Rockland ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,My family has been with Dr Lorah for well over 20 years and he is the best most attentive and personal Dr we have ever had the experience to meet He is cordial friendly and a straight shooting gentleman that reminds you of what Drs must have been in the way back days Will always make you feel welcome and cared for New location in Pearl River but no matter where he is you should use him as your personal and family DR You will feel like he is a member of your own family thats how much we value him ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jeffrey_M_Wilson_2 html, Jeffrey M Wilson ,I was a patient of Doctor Wilson for 8 years He was good as long as the patient doesn't end up with serious health issues he takes time in referring to specialists But that doesn't help patient always Sometimes delaying a specialist visit can hurt the patient's health very bad I had a very experience and now I realized that when you really need help this doctor is not good at all ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jeffrey_M_Wilson_2 html, Jeffrey M Wilson ,I changed doctors after too many visits to a doctor who was wrong for me Dr Wilson puts his patients first He listens to your concerns and addresses any questions you have He makes suggestions for treatment options and lets you decide what works best for you He follows up his diagnosis with tests just to be sure He calls to check up on you and if you miss your appointment his office calls to reschedule and makes a reminder call I am going to live a long time ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,So glad to be finding another physician Miss Dr Garg and would NEVER use Dr Alves again if she was the last physician on earth She is cold confrontational unprofessional and vindictive She has no bedside manner and no patience when dealing with individuals with special needs or complex medical conditions ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,I've been a patient of Dr Alves for quite sometime now She is very patient and caring towards my health needs I would highly recommend her to others,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,condescending and not in the best interests of the patient I have to wonder why I encouraged such a challenge when trying to find out medical answers I thought she would be a member of the team I guessed wrong Did I have an off day with her ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,i never had to think about changing my PCP until I visited DR Alves She is very distant and rushes you and you literally sit in the room with her no more then 10 min she doesn't answer your questions of your concerns she just prescribes you meds she tried enrcouraging me to take depression meds more than once when I overly told her I was not depressed   im not in denial either  I am a very rounded person who can control their feelings however I wouldn't waste my time or money here ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,The office staff and Dr Alves are all very professional She took care of me when my own doctor was ill and I stayed with her Dr Alves is very thorough and she really really listens She addresses each and every concern and admits when she doesn't know something and needs to refer I admire and respect that she knows her limits ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,in and out of the room needs to spend more time with patients ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,Dr Alves is warm kind thorough and very consciencious She runs on time and takes the time to answer all questions and address all concerns ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,I had the same reaction to this office cranky staff always like you were bothering them I too found Dr Alves' treatment very cold and uninterested in my concerns to the point of acting preoccupied Always used a weight related diagnosis Once during a gyn exam walked out of the exam room and left the door open to get speculums out of the closet across the hall I never went back ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,My doctor has excellent diagnostic skills and a great bedside manner I never wait in the waiting room more than 5 monutes yet I am never rushed in the patient care room Each concern is addressed and sheis great with explanations My whole family and my parents have her as a doctor,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,The office staff runs the appointments to the second and were completely rude to me when I was once 5 minutes late Also very abrubt and cold in their overall communications with you More importantly however is Dr Alves Very distant uncaring attitude Barely talks to you to the point where it's a bit uncomfortable Seems totally burnt out and just going through the motions Not a good trait for a health care professional Time to take a vacation or think about a second career ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Joyce_Alves html, Joyce A Alves ,She is very sweet and caring Great doctor for any age The office visits are quick and you barely have enough time to get to a chair and sit when they call you in I've been with her for over 3 years and I love the whole staff It's really a family proctice your a name to them not a number If she can't handle your case because it is too specialised she has a wide range of specialty doctors that can take care of you She is very well known by other specialty doctors and they all have high regards for her ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Judith_Mccole html, Judith M Mccole , but her office staff is terrible Long wait times on the phone Have to call multiple times to get re fill or referral They are courteous when there Maybe they need more help ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Judith_Mccole html, Judith M Mccole ,Doctor basically yelled at me for requesting what she called  a magic pill when I asked for help controlling my excessive sugar intake She followed up with insulting me as a mother Very nice I left feeling attacked and overwhelmed This doctor will not be part of your healthcare team  She is arrogant rude and does not listen She immediately places the patient in some sort of self determined category and treats from that perspective She did take time to talk to me or rather at me She also required a contract in which I agreed never to abuse my ADD medicine something no other doctor has ever done and left me feeling unfortunately that something was wrong with me for taking the prescribed medication for a medical issue I switched to another doctor in the same practice and was treated with respect instead of suspicion Compassion and empathy is a priority for me  accurate and intelligent diagnoses does take priority  but kindness allows the trust that is vital to a patient talking of personal medical concerns I would be reluctant to discuss other issues with this doctor and that is unacceptable ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Judith_Mccole html, Judith M Mccole ,I have been a pt of Dr McCole since she was in Londonderry and followed her to the Bedford practice because she was such a good Dr Since the Elliot takeover this office has taken a nosedive I'm in the process of looking for a new Dr after being rushed out of the office and having to see their resident rather than my own Dr  and this resident cannot think his way out of a paper bag  I am completely disgusted I just got done spending a WEEK in the hospital after a minor stroke  because the resident had consistently missed my symptoms in my *4* previous visits  and was told that Dr McCole did not have time to see me as she does not work on Mondays and is booked solid Can't get away from them fast enough ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karen_Smigel html, Karen R Smigel ,Dr Karen Smigel is an excellent doctor that I highly recommend She is courteous professional and truly listens to her patients The staff is extremely pleasant to talk with and very efficient in requesting anything needed ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karen_Smigel html, Karen R Smigel ,I'm totally impressed with Dr Smigel She is very down to earth and friendly She always spends her time with me and answers any questions I have thoroughly I never have to wait more than a few days for test results the office is very prompt I only wish it were easier to get appointments with her ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karen_Smigel html, Karen R Smigel ,Unfortunately I have had to find a new primary care physician due to a change in my insurance I am heartbroken to have to leave Dr Smigel She is the most professional and knowledgeable physician I have ever been to She followed up on every aspect of my medical care including a visit to the ER and a report she received about a mammogram and breast ultrasound that I had She wanted to be sure that I understood the results My last PCP never took the time to call me at home I will miss Dr Smigel and hope that she will accept me back in a couple of years when I will be using Medicare I recommend her highly ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karin_Janet_Hemmingsen html, Karin J Hemmingsen ,Dr Hemmingsen is the doctor I have been looking for for 15 years I have a very rare condition and no other doctor has taken the time to try and understand my condition and help me I have gone to dozens of doctors and have never found one as caring and helpful as Dr Hemmingsen ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karin_Janet_Hemmingsen html, Karin J Hemmingsen ,Dr Hemmingsen is a great doctor however office staff is rude and disorganized and do not return urgent calls or follow through with insurance paperwork or referrals Unfortunately due to the utter incompetence and lack of empathy and follow through from the staff I will be forced to find a new doc ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karin_Janet_Hemmingsen html, Karin J Hemmingsen ,I came to Dr Hemmingsen after having a terrible time with another Doctor She was nice caring and interested in what I was saying helped me get the care I needed Finally I've found the right Doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karla_Christo html, Karla S Christo ,Since I meet Dr Christo 3+ Years ago I have had nothing but excellent service from the front desk  staff  to the Doctor herself Dr Christo has in all honesty saved my life and I could never be more grateful Her professionalism her dedication to the patients is outstanding I have never meet anyone that comes close to Dr Christo that is why I would never change PCP  EVER   If there is a negative review against this Dr it is because they didn't have something go their why ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karla_Christo html, Karla S Christo ,I found her to be the worst PCP I've ever dealt with and the office staff is outright rude When I first called for an appt and a wellness visit because I had changed ins co and needed a new PCP I was told she didn't do wellness visits but I could book an appt for a physical and she would see me then That appt took 6 mos I called to try and see her because I knew my thyroid med was off and causing me problems and they wouldn't give me an appt right away When I did see her she made no effort to take into consideration what I was telling her or even listened to what I was saying about my symptoms The whole appt all of the 15 minutes she spent with me was ridiculous I left and immediately began my search for a new PCP ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karla_Christo html, Karla S Christo ,She is attentive she cares about her patients she listended to my problems I feel confident with her diagnosis and her care I feel Dr Christo really cares about my health What a great doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karla_Christo html, Karla S Christo ,Just the best PCP I ever had ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Karla_Christo html, Karla S Christo ,It is always difficult when you move and are forced to find a new PCP So much so that I kept my old PCP for 4 yrs and traveled over one hour for a visit But the time came to find a new doctor and Dr Christo was recommended by a friend My experience was great I felt so at ease with her and she was so sweet friendly and a great listener She devoted so much time to me and my husband I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Katharina_Lilly html, Katharina F Lilly ,It's not complicated we all want a physician that we can trust  someone who covers all the bases and is compassionate with our particular circumstances In essence Dr Lilly presents both sides of the coin a warm heart and a quick and perceptive intelligence It's a wonderful combination that puts you at ease while at the same time gives you the confidence to face your realities For the majority of time I live in South America running a coffee farm and yet I make the 3 000 mile trip for my annul exam as well as any other significant concern Need I say more about how highly I recommend Dr Lilly ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Katharina_Lilly html, Katharina F Lilly ,I originally started seeing Dr Lilly 6+ years ago when I was living in Portsmouth at the time the office was a few minutes from my home and workplace  5 years ago I moved so that it is 45 minutes from my home but the level of care has been so excellent that I would not consider changing doctors ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Katharina_Lilly html, Katharina F Lilly ,Dr Lily is amazing She was able to detect a possible torn meniscus Since she knew I was training for an Ironman she ordered an MRI right away rather than wait She helped expedite the process I had an MRI the next day she called me back with the results that afternoon  yes it was a torn meniscus  and she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon that I saw the next day She's amazing friendly and responsive to my needs I highly recommend her ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Katherine_Williams html, Katherine S Williams ,If I could give her no stars I would This was the worst experience I have ever had with a dr Would never recommend to anyone and would never let my family and friends see her I left completely unsatisfied and with no answers She would not listen to what I had to say and was practically trying to shut me up All she would do was tell me what she knew and would not let me explain myself All I heard while she was talking was her pretty much telling I went to see a dr for nothing When I know it is not nothing All she was trying to do was change my mind as to why I was there and convince me that there is nothing wrong After her being my second dr I saw for the same reason I am still looking for answers due to the fact that she did not try diagnosising me and was just trying to get me out of there Overall worst experience ever would not recommend and will not be going to any location she works at ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Katherine_Williams html, Katherine S Williams ,Really poor people skills and terrible bedside manner Not recommended by this patient,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_Wilson_3 html, Kathryn J Maier ,I went through 4 disastrous PCPs before finding Dr Maier and I couldn't be happier with her She is professional kind and skilled She takes time to listen and has an excellent bedside manner She took time to carefully consider different medication options for my condition and her nursing staff is very friendly I highly recommend her and am thankful I no longer have to search for a fabulous PCP ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,Very responsive to needs Refers promptly when necessary Listens is open to suggestion Very satisfied ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,I would NOT recommend Dr Ellis to anyone She prescribed me the wrong dose of an anxiety medication 8x the normal dose This was confirmed by the ER doctor ER counselor and pharmacist Too bad I didn't know this until after taking it for 2 weeks and felt CRAZY When I told Dr Ellis of my side effects she insisted that I was wrong and that I instead needed to take more of the medication during the day TERRIBLE DOCTOR ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,Dr Ellis was highly recommended by my oncologist as I was looking for a new primary I was able to book an appointment in a timely manner The office staff was efficient and courteous I was seen promptly Dr Ellis had a quiet bedside manner and listened attentively I now have a new primary with whom I am completely satisfied ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,Dr Ellis did not have my best interest She does not think outside the box and was very reluctant to listen to me and help me with certain medications She needs to be more open with dialogue and to listen to her patients She is rushed as well and her follow up is awful ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,This practice continues to keep incorrect records and billing errors Receptionists are rude and hang up on you when trying to contact the office Dr Ellis does not make any effort to investigate issues quick to address symptom only and is very rushed ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,Dr Ellis is a responsive and informed physician I was impressed with how she was aware of the importance of Vitamin D supplementation in the Northeast which not all physicians embrace She was open to testing my Vitamin D levels when I asked  this is exactly the type of communication and partnership that is required for a successful treating relationship ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,Dr Ellis has a bit of an attitude and not only rushed out of the appointment but when I had a question had a really bad attitude about stopping to hear it and provide an answer She was also not well informed about a medication and insisted it was for something other than what it is classified for or prescribed for which was not for an off label use She was less than professional and what was either a nurse or a medical assistant almost messed up an injection I actually has to be the one to stop her and correct it so poor communication skills seem to be the norm for this office I would not recommend her and I am switching That was my very first visit there too and it seemed quiet and not busy There really should be a better mechanism in place for tracking doctors that are either unprofessional or clearly need some professional help ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kathryn_R_Ellis html, Kathryn R Ellis ,I like Dr Ellis however the office staff is horrible We have been given wrong medical advise from someone claiming to be a nurse but was a medical assistant Refusal to pass information on the the md for a prescription request and just generalized rudeness,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kavita_Ketwaroo html, Kavita D Ketwaroo ,Felt she didn't listen to my concerns stuck to her by the book diagnosis Also changed my medication without talking with me first & had her nurse explain it me when I called to question why they wouldn't refill it Since I was taking the med for a different reason than typically prescribed that change was not going to work for me Changed PCP asap ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Keith_Lammers html, Keith A Lammers ,sent to the wrong specialist for which I was charged anyway Great bedside manner  all bedside manner  but fails to listen ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kelly_Hoye html, Kelly L Hoye ,Dr Kelly Hoye has a disgraceful bedside manner She was my mother primary care physician for many years My mother went to her for some abdominal pain They did some tests Dr Hoye called my mother into go over her test results Dr Hoye told my mother she had two weeks to live Dr Hoye rather than having someone accompany my mother for the visit allowed her to come alone gave her the bad news and then allowed a 81 year old women drive home alone after telling her the dire news Dr Hoye is a disgrace to the medical profession ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kelly_Hoye html, Kelly L Hoye ,I had been a patient for many years As her practice grew her attention to detail failed Finally changed Dr's only to find out at that time how much had been overlooked or not even noticed It is all well and good to chat in a friendly manner when seeing a patient but you also need to be a Dr as well There were mis read test that could very well have been a deadly mistake Dr Hoye PLEASE start paying more attention ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khwaja_Hussain html, Khwaja A Hussain ,When my son's pediatrician retired we decided to try other drs in his practice So many were cold and it didn't feel like they actually cared about us I decided we should give Dartmouth a try and we're matched with Dr Hussein This doctor truly cares He is incredibly thorough and makes sure my son is healthy mind body and soul With a rare genetic disorder the recent death of his father and being 16 and all the difficulties surrounding that Dr Hussein goes above and beyond to ensure my child is healthy happy and cared for 5 stars is not enough for this excellent doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khwaja_Hussain html, Khwaja A Hussain ,Dr Hussain is a knowledgeable thorough and exceptionally competent medical professional He is a most compassionate attentive and caring individual He is also my husband's primary care physician and we both agree that he takes the time to listen to us as individuals not just another patient He answers all of our questions clearly and effectively We always look forward to his exceptional care in follow up visits ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khwaja_Hussain html, Khwaja A Hussain ,Great primary care physician Listens and responds I trust him with my complicated care I always feel like a person never just a patient or a disease ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khwaja_Hussain html, Khwaja A Hussain ,I had mostly preferred women doctors in the past and requested one as a new patient at Avis Goodwin but was introduced to Dr Hussain for my first general checkup appointment Dr Hussain is not only a knowledgeable and exceptionally competent medical professional he is without a doubt the most compassionate attentive and caring individual I've ever had in a patient/doctor relationship He took the time to listen to me as an individual not just another patient and effectively answered all of my questions I always looked forward to his exceptional care in follow up visits If it weren't for his attentive health interest and medical knowledge during my first visit what I believed was just a pimple on my face turned out to be basal cell carcinoma which is currently being treated by a dermatologist I can't thank him enough for that kind of attention and care A good doctor is hard to find a *great* doctor seemed impossible until I met Dr Hussain I don't casually hand out five star ratings but my experience with Dr Hussain merits it ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khyati_A_Patel html, Khyati A Patel ,She is caring intelligent and astute in her diagnosis Within hours of our meeting she arranged for the CT scan I needed The outcome of the scan eliminated what another doctor incorrectly diagnosed ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khyati_A_Patel html, Khyati A Patel ,Dr Patel is the best doctor I have had in years She listens to me and works with me She is so nice and I never feel rushed She is very smart and easy to communicate with Her diagnosis's have been spot on and her recommendations have been so helpful in dealing with my health issues With her care and treatment I feel better and am healthier than I have been in years Thanks Dr Patel,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Khyati_A_Patel html, Khyati A Patel ,Dr Patel is the worst and most unprofessional doctor I have ever had an appointment with I went to see her after visiting several other dermatologists for a severe rash I am 20 years old and had my father attend all previous appointments with me at various locations When I went to my first  and last  visit with Dr Patel she asked him to leave so that I could change  not by my request  and then refused to let him back in the room after I asked to go get him SEVERAL times I felt trapped in a room and believe that she was aggressive and completely unprofessional I would not recommend her services to anyone I do not think she should have a license to practice ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Zeller html, Kimberly A Zeller ,Great MD very caring definatelly attends to a patient needs ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Zeller html, Kimberly A Zeller ,This Doctor enters first appointment with Exuberance She is everything you want a doctor to be She is very thorough ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Zeller html, Kimberly A Zeller ,Dr Zeller was my doctor in California throughout my pregnancy She was an amazing caring doctor She delivered my daughter Heaven Although my delivery had some complications she did everything she could to make me feel at ease and she helped me through it all I was so very sad to see her leave that doctors office and even more sad when I knew she would be leaving the state all together She without a doubt was one of the best doctors I have ever had ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,I was initially impressed with her ability to explain things concisely and fully However she has failed to review my record on numerous occasions When I came for a specific issue she did not review my record and ended up prescribing a medication which SHE had previously prescribed and did not work  I did not recognize the brand name when she mentioned it at the appointment and agreed to the prescription  Had she reviewed my record regarding that medical issue she would have known which medications I had already tried The visit resulted in a waste of my money and Dr McKean did not even apologize but stated it was my fault for not letting her know I had taken the medication before I let the incident go but kept noticing that although Dr McKean answered questions thoroughly during visits she simply had a poor understanding of my health record and would not review even before appointments that were meant to address a specific issue I do not expect doctors to remember everything about a patient but if a patient comes in for a specific issue the doctor should at the very least review the record regarding that issue in advance At the very least the doctor should know which medications she had previously prescribed for that issue Dr McKean is no longer my PCP ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,Doesn't appear to recall last visit and/or test results Maybe doesn't have time to review records before visit but doesn't instill confidence Quicker to write prescriptions rather than offer more life style changes nutrition consult or post menopausal diet changes Considering change in PCP ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,She is very thorough and seemed like she really cared about me ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,I found her to be rude and didn't let me get a word in She barely asked me about my symptoms before she told me what I needed to do She talked to me like I was a child being reprimanded and seemed visibly annoyed by being there at all ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,I was referred to her by another doctor in the practice I met with her one time and will not again She had no interest in what I had to ask about my health and was very judgemental I am a health care professional and I felt as if I was being talked down to at a third grade level I felt as if I was treated as incompetent She has no bedside manner what so ever changing my PCP as we speak ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,I have seen Dr Mckean now for the last 2 3 yrs she has always been very up front with me and straight forward She listens very well and then formulates a thorough plan and follow up I have always been very happy and impressed with her efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment I would highly recommend her as a doctor she also explains things very well and I never feel like I can not ask a question ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,Dr McKean has been my PCP for the past 3 years I chose her because of the location and it was convenient for me My first initial visit with her was blah but I though I would give her a chance I am very healthy overall anyway  I figured I only need to see her once a year I like Dartmouth Hitchcock the OB/Gyn team is awesome especially during my 2nd pregnancy But I feel that I need to be able to rely on my PCP and I got the sense that she doesn't really care of any issues during my pregnancy considering I had issues on my 1st The few visits I had with her were very short  with long waits  I get it I am very healthy but I expect more than just OK you're good  from my PCP I felt like she's rushing and just assume that I have no health problem ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,Dr McKean is one of the first Physicians I've actually felt comfortable with at Dartmouth Hitchcock She is easy to talk to and seems very knowledgeable in medicine I would recommend her to friends and family ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,Dr McKean has never been abrupt with me She is in fact much more thorough than other PCP's I have had She is results oriented and doesn't hesitate to come up with a plan She is friendly and I feel I have her total attention I would highly recommend her PLUS she had evening hours and that is a big help ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,Dr McKean has been my doctor for about 5 years I agree getting to know her may be a little difficult but we only get 15 minutes Despite that when I was diagnosed with cancer she made sure she was updated by every other doctor I saw She actually wrote in my records all appointments should be scheduled for 30 minutes She has always given me complete information regarding any illness treatment or medication that is at hand I have nothing but complete confidence in my care with her ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,I have only seen Dr McKean twice and will be choosing another primary care physician She is terrible to speak with her mannerisms and comments lead you to believe that you are there wasting her time She is VERY brash with comments and doesn't listen to anything you are trying to tell her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,Dr McKean has a terrible bedside manner She is very condescending and abrupt I have chosen another doctor as my primary care She made me feel like a nuisance and I am someone who only goes to the doctors if I absolutely have to ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,The staff at the Dartmouth Hitchcock facility is great They are all super nice However this doctor in particular is a little hard to get used too I don't know if it's her personality per se but she doesn't appear to listen to the patient's concern I understand doctors are really busy but she seems to yes you to death when you have legit concerns ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kimberly_Mckean html, Kimberly M Mckean ,This Doctor does not listen at all and is verbally combative ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Newsom html, Kristen E Newsom ,The appointment was rushed wish we had had more time ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Newsom html, Kristen E Newsom ,This doctor rushed through the appointment and didn't listen to what I was saying Will not go back ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Newsom html, Kristen E Newsom ,Dr Newsom was very kind not judgmental she made me feel safe and she filled my prescriptions immediately ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Goodell html, Kristen H Goodell ,Dr Goodell is an excellent physician who listens well and is clear in her explanations to the layman She is honest when it comes to medical realities but somehow manages to maintain a positive spin during the most negative of circumstances She has a great sense of humor very important sometimes at a doctor's office when there are more occasions for tears than laughter  and most importantly she really cares about the patients A real person and a real doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Goodell html, Kristen H Goodell ,I have several congenital health issues to contend with Dr Goodell has always been compassionate helpful and accurate regarding her diagnosis and treatments of my ailments She is very patient when she deals with my fears and attentively listens to me She is a superb doctor ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Goodell html, Kristen H Goodell ,The last three visits  which included today  I have had to wait 30min 45min before my baby son and I were called into the baby room  yes room for babies/kids only as I'm told The total duration of our visit was 1 hour and 45 minutes The last two visits I agree for the student  why not they need the exposure  which took another 20 min before he came in After the student leaves Dr Goodell comes in after 10 minutes She is an excellent knowledgeable doctor and has a great personality However the waiting time is too long especially now that it has happened three time My son's next appointment  6 month appt  is at 7am in a few months if it means having to book an earlier appointment to skip all this waiting I think a new family practice will be decided ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristen_Goodell html, Kristen H Goodell ,I was impressed with the instant rapport between my child and the doctor There was also a student doctor and she was very kind as well We got a lot of great information and I felt the doctor spent a lot of time with my child which left them positive about their doctor visit meaning it won't be difficult to get them to go next time ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristin_Schofield html, Kristin N Schofield ,dr schofield is very knowledgeable smart personaable and very easy to talk to about any medical issue  even if you feel somewhat disturdeb about speaking about it I would reccommend her to ANY prospective patient She and her staff are very good ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristin_Burdick html, Kristin O Burdick ,As an 11 year stage 4 cancer patient I have had care from more doctors than you could imagine I ended up with her just by chance at the last minute because my doc was out for the day She is by far the best Doctor I have ever seen for anything Her knowledge ease of communication compassion and ethics are by far the best I ve ever encountered If you ever get the slim chance of acquiring her as your primary care physician Jump on it there is no one quite like her anywhere ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristin_Burdick html, Kristin O Burdick ,Kristin is an outstanding physician She takes the time to assess your problem listen to you as an individual Top notch first rate see no one else ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristin_Vaughan html, Kristin R Vaughan ,I began seeing Dr Vaughan as my primary care doctor when I was still a child As a teenager she treated me with distrust and condescension not taking me seriously when I had an injury as severe as a herniated disc at 16 In my late 20s I returned with another serious condition experiencing paralysis loss of motor function and unbearable pain Dr Vaughan dismissed my complaints refused to treat my pain and finally referred me to a neurologist who said I was fine An Emergency Room spinal tap and MRI less than a week later revealed a plum sized brain tumor almost entirely compressing my brain stem If I had the power to strip people of their medical licenses this is the only one I would take She treated me like a drug seeking hypochondriac since I was a kid and failed in her duty to care for me as an adult I'm 36 now and live on the other side of the country but I still wake up at night haunted by the way she treated me It affects my relationships with all of my current doctors and if I had it to take back I would sue her and the entire practice for failing to diagnose my almost fatal condition Whatever you do don't send your vulnerable children to her  she warped my trust in medical professionals completely ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kristin_Vaughan html, Kristin R Vaughan ,I recommend that you interview Dr Vaughn before chosing her as your doctor this practice has lost what it once had that being concern for patients now its all about the cash ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kyle_Murray html, Kyle R Murray ,He is not only full of himself making me wait every time for at least an hour he comes unprepared and uninterested Ladies don't bother Even with a serious condition you are just making noise and he has already tuned you out ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kyle_Murray html, Kyle R Murray ,Dr Murray was my doctor I went to him because I was concerned about swelling ankles When I tried to tell him that I had had a problem w/my leg he said I only want to talk about what you made the appointment for He spent most of the time w/me typing his notes and not really listening to me ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kyle_Murray html, Kyle R Murray ,He was the worst doctor I've ever had Wouldn't recommend him to give my dog an examination ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kyle_Murray html, Kyle R Murray ,Dr Murray is one of the most compassionate doctors I've ever been to He never makes me feel rushed He listens to my concerns and educates me about my condition He is not quick to prescribe pain meds like some doctors who just want to get the patient in and out If I have to wait for him it's ok because I know he will spend the time with me that I need ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kyle_Murray html, Kyle R Murray ,Office staff are very good once you get in exam room nurse does prelims I have actually waited up to an hour and a half for him to walk in and then doesn't even have my charts I have a good medical background and honestly I think I know more than he does he never wants to take any time w/patients never listens to problems etc ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Kyle_Murray html, Kyle R Murray ,Dr Murray fails to listen to his patients opinion even when the patient has 25 years experience dealing with his ailment it's proven that acute pain elevates blood pressure but the good doctor refuses to treat for pain and would rather send me to a cardiologist  several times only to be personally chastised by the cardiologist for being there with an acute condition which keeps my BP elevated to over 240/145,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Most memorable part was walking out the door knowing I wouldn't be back Rude You get charged for things you shouldn't HIPPA vilations Yep telling me what is in someone else's' chart is kind of a big no no But awesome to now knownmy brother has depression Just run Not worth the high blood pressure you will get The only good part was the nurse practitioner and even she ran for the hills Protect yourself care for yourself If you are with a doctor who doesn't like you asking question it is time for you to find a new doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Dr Attar has been my PCP for over 5 years She is very attentive and caring ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,She really cares about me She know 's who I am and why I am there She is always on top of the situation and she is reassuring ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,I just read the reviews for Dr Attar I just moved to town and saw her sign Thought I might make an appointment After reading these reviews I DON'T THINK SO Hope she and her staff pay attention to the reviews and realize that they may be keeping new patients from making appointments with her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Was looking for a local PCP Haven't had one in many years since its so hard to find a good one Just picked Dr Attars name out from a google search was able to get an appointment rather quickly The staff was great there I had to bring my 10 month old daughter with me and everyone was fine with that Dr Attar spent plenty of time with me and was very nice and thorough Glad I finally found a good local PCP ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Office staff extremely rude and unprofessional while on hold waiting for appointment heard receptionist complaining Stood at window for several minutes waiting to check in was completely ignored Once she slid window open no greeting just rude y asked for my name I then proceeded to wait for 40 minutes before being called in then once I got in sat in the office for another 20 To many patients for a one women show Felt rushed and her staff needs a course in customer service ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,I decided to take my newborn baby there The staff was very RUDE and UNWELCOMING Definitely not what a doctor's staff should be like I didn't like the office surroundings they made me feel like I was in a basement The doctor herself was just ok I did not feel like I wanted to deal with this staff everytime I had to call or come in with my baby I switched doctor's immediately Thank God,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Everything is horrible about this practice starting from the rude and fake receptionist to the 1 hour wait to be seen following 30 min wait in the room to Dr Attar spending 3 min with the patient while the practice is empty and Dr Attar is talking on the phone where the wine tasting should be for the night The operating hours are HORRIBLE That practice is more closed than open while is the only one in town Also they are only associated with Nashoba Hospital which is the worst hospital ever And if you want to go to a different one you have to do everything yourself Also they will never refill your prescriptions unless she Dr Attar sees you If you suffer from chronic sinus infections and when you call you just want the prescription you have to be seen first Seriously They claim to be personable however Dr Attar never returns a phone call They have the help return calls and when you ask for more questions they go back and forth like a broken phone game Come on wouldn't it be easier for all if she just picked up the phone Even when they return calls with results its usually a month later In a mean while someone could die They need to step it up big times because people's lives are at risk while they could care less Sadly though a lot of people in town do not believe they will change unless someone sues them ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Dr Attar was my physician for a number of years I received good care I've certainly had far worse care since I moved to Florida I always got a personal call from the office following any tests sometime well past the time the office closed ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,#NAME ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laila_Attar html, Laila Attar ,Even though I have health insurance They pay a percentage and then I pay the rest No co pay with plan so between my husband and I we owe a balance of like $200 00 which I really can't understand either because of the outstanding balance I am refused care and only get partial refills on important prescriptions So we end up at the ER if we get sick Seems crazy to hold health insurance and not able to see doctor seems whatever oath the doctor took is thrown out the window because of money I suffer in pain with scar tissue from past surgeries and that doctors office is less than caring I live out of the way from cities and Attars is very close to home but she is no small town doctor she is just greedy,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lara_Moody html, Lara W Moody ,Very caring ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lara_Moody html, Lara W Moody ,Think the person who commented negatively was mistaking Dr Moody for someone else Has to be an error First Dr Moody has never been rude or unprofessional once in her entire career Second she wasn't working at Farmington for over a year when the negative comment was written ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lara_Moody html, Lara W Moody ,I was her patient and she was the best doctor I ever had I am a stroke and seizure and she showed me so such compassion I miss her and if she ever opens a practice I will be her patient in a new York minute ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lara_Moody html, Lara W Moody ,Dr Moody was wonderful with me during my appointments I would highly recommend her actually I did and now my husband goes to her which was a hard thing for him to do as he'd never had a female doctor My daughter and mother in law also go to her and we're all very happy ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lara_Moody html, Lara W Moody ,I bring my elderly Mother to appointments with Dr Moody She is kind warm knowledgeable thorough and all the things A Dr should be & unfortunately aren't these days Oh & she's on time for our appt's ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_B_Zucker html, Laura B Zucker ,Could not be bothered to listen to me and shut down communication before the conversation even began Totally unethical Caused days of needless suffering and now bc of her negligence it is unclear when I will get the medicine I need I have a serious illness and I found her dismissed treatment of me as a patient unconscionable ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_B_Zucker html, Laura B Zucker ,I waited 6 days for a routine renewal of a thyroid RX refill The office said Dr Z had a  She never bothered to have her staff call me about her concern until I was out of pills  I called again on a Tuesday They said she'd be back on Weds On Weds the office called to say she had a Still no refill Yes she did tweak the dosage of a DIFFERENT thyroid med But NOT THIS ONE How irresponsible to deny me my medication that I've been on for 46 years because she had a that was not asked for 6 days Then I was made to call back and wait 10 minutes for the : how many pills do you need This is in my chart To be made to wait 6 days and go without medication is unacceptable This is not the first time this Dr has messed up ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_B_Zucker html, Laura B Zucker ,Dr Zucker is not as good as the reviews claim Her professionality has declined since she started getting more accolades in the industry Late to appointments by an hour inappropriate comments directed at patient irresponsible and inaccurate medication titration I finally just switched physicians ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_B_Zucker html, Laura B Zucker ,Nice but calls you in too many times It turns out that providers do this to raise charges ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_B_Zucker html, Laura B Zucker ,Very professional doctor and very good with the little ones She will play along with the children's needs as they grow showing them things and keeping them interested in the exam as a play time rather than a doctor visit Thank you for your care we will miss you ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,Went to this doctor for 6 7 years Shame on me I waited an hour at least an hour every time I always asked if the doctor was running on time and was always told yes only to yet again wait one hour I finally came to my senses after waiting one hour and walked out without seeing the doctor They do not return phone calls in a timely manner and seemed confused when calling for blood work results One person will tell you yes they are in Then a day layer the lad oh no not in They are so incompetent It's a wonder to me how they still have a business,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,By all means DON'T go to Dr Henseler She's condescending if you ask her questions and although she keeps YOU waiting and waiting and waiting once she's in the room with you she's in a hurry to get your appointment over and done with so she can be on to the next patient Horrible ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,I have been going to South County Hospital for 3 years now My primary care doctor is FANTASTIC He's super informative and takes the time to personally follow up with me versus having a random nurse call However this past week I started experiencing symptoms that were consistent with a UTI Any woman who has ever had one know that the main symptom is stinging when urinating I called in to make a same day appointment and was informed that my primary care doctor was on vacation and I could be seen by Dr Henseler After the unnecessary 30 minute wait  I was the ONLY one in the waiting room  i was brought in by the nurse who went through the motions of taking all of my vitals and asking why I was in to see the doctor so j told her everything She warned me that Dr Henseler likes to take her sweet time so to speed things up for me she had me do the urine sample early on I waited another 15 20 minutes before Dr Henseler decided to come see me and the very first thing that she asks is so why are you in today What symptoms have you been experiencing and I thought to myself  after making me wait all of this time couldn't you have had the courtesy to read the nurses notes and have some idea of what's going on with me  So I begin to explain  all over again  that what I have been experiencing is consistent with a UTI and before I could finish I was interrupted and in the most condescending voice I have ever heard she says to me again what are the SYMPTOMS you are having so I broke everything down for her from start to finish Then she tells me that my urine sample came back negative for any infection so I ask what else it could be and so she asks if I am sexually active  which normally I am but hadn't been since the symptoms started I have been with the same person for 5 years and we still get checked every year  after I tell her yes but not recently she blurts out CHLAMYDIA now you can imagine the shock I was unable to hide from my face She starts to elaborate and say a lot of the symptoms you have expressed leads me to believe it could be Chlamydia so naturally I explain how it is highly unlikely and ask what else it could be which seemed to annoy her so she begins suggesting that I have a small urethra so I ask if it is something that develops later in life and she explains that I would have been that way all my life and I begin to question her saying well if I had that would it sting every time I went pee my whole life and she began to fumble her words and say the only way to really determine what it is would be to do a pelvic exam at this point I've been insulted mislead misdiagnosed and have had my time completely wasted so I declined Also questioning whether she is even qualifies to perform pelvic exams on a whim  my understanding is that is what gynecologists are for  so at the end of everything I explain again I came in because I believed I had a serious infection and know that I am in pain so I was hoping to get some sort of antibiotic to flush my system and properly take care of my infection but you're telling me you don't think there is anything wrong with me and therefore you will not research further or prescribe me anything for the pain  Her response was a shrug of the shoulders and it really could be chlamydia but we will never know unless you have a pelvic exam in the mean time I can refer you to a urinologist in summary Dr Henseler took 2 hours of my time to leave me more worried and confused than when I walked in the door Needless to say I'm writing this from the emergency room where they chose to research further by taking blood samples x days and ultr sounds and I have unfortunately have gallbladder stones Dr Henseler simply did not WANT to help me so she didn't I have NEVER encountered such an apathetic doctor in my adult life I will NEVER see her again under ANY circumstances I'm writing this review as someone who genuinely cares about other people please save your frustration and time and DO NOT see Dr Henseler I'm afraid you will leave highly disappointed ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,Bluntly put I am seeking another primary care physician I began going to Dr Henseler back in 2012 Some of my visits with her were overall OK but most were I feel just simply because she wanted my co payment and to be able to bill my insurance company for an unnecessary visit I have been on the same medication now since 2001 for anxiety It is something that I will likely need to take for the rest of my life Well Dr Henseler wanted to adjust my dosage which was determined to be a mistake so she agreed after attempting to adjust my dosage that I just need to stay on the 20mg per day Well EVERY SINGLE TIME I have needed Dr authorization to refill this prescription WITHOUT FAIL her nurse will tell me that Dr Henseler will NOT refill it for me unless I make an appointment to see her WHAT Why in the world does she need to see me first It's already been determined I'm on the correct dosage Or her so called nurse who is definitely not the most efficient person for SURE has dropped the ball with my prescription by sending it to the WRONG pharmacy on more than one occasion will say the she will refill the medication FOR NOW but within 30 days I need to see Dr Henseler This to me is ridiculous and perhaps even bordering on unethical When I do see her she walks in the room without having a clue as to why I am there and will ask me why I'm here Seriously Don't you read my chart Don't you make notes Anyway I'm getting a little tired of doing this dance with her and I'm done Let somebody else help to put her kids through college and Catholic Schools I DO NOT RECOMMEND this doctor AT ALL ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,I have been seeing Dr Henseler for maybe 3 years now Simply said the wait is about 40 45 minutes every single time weather it is a previously scheduled appt or same day She does not listen to what you are telling her she does not review your file before coming in the room and never has a clue what is going on or what happened at previous appointments She is so quick to blame everything on anxiety and she contradicts everything Find another doctor I once saw another one of the women doctors in the office and thought she was fantastic she was such a breath of fresh air compared to Dr Henseler I do not recommend Some doctors are in it to help people and some are just in it for the money and are just trying to get through the day I'm sure you could guess what type i think she is Also every time i try to get in she is either out it is her day off or she is leaving early On a better note the staff is great and the office is nice comfortable and has a small table with books for kids ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,I actually had to leave Dr Henseller's office the other day before I was even able to be seen by her for a follow up appointment because the wait was SO LONG I mean our time is valuable too right Anyway I also keep getting calls from her office  recording  that tell me I have an appointment at a certain time on a certain day which is INCORRECT I just had to complain about this again  today Office staff is nice enough but to put it bluntly they are not the brightest bulbs in the box  I mean if you have to change your appointment why don't they take out the original time you had THEN put you in the new day/time like every other office does That's why I keep getting called for appointment day/times that I don't have I also don't think that Dr Henseller checked through my medical records from my previous doctor before she started changing my medications and dosages She is very nice but truthfully once my follow up appointment with her is done I'm going to another doctor and I've already started looking around Overall I'm not impressed ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,waited all day to get an appt with nurse practitioner then waited over 50 minutes at appt time until she came in Initial nurse was rude stood fiddling with thermostat in hall instead of showing me to the room NP also rude rushed exam and then no treatment for my ear infection ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,I felt she has to many people to see she did not connect with me and brushed of how I was feeling I have seen her twice and I actively looking for another Doctor at this time ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,Dr Henseler really cares Unlike other doctors she spends a great deal of time talking with the patient Most doctors rush me in and out Dr Henseler doesn't She answers all of my questions and doesnt make me feel like I'm one of thousands The office is easy to get to and the staff treated me well I've already told my friends to switch to Dr Henseler ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,Getting an appointment with this doctor is a torturous nightmare the staff clearly have it in for men so its' best if your wife calls they hate men If you try to call them they do NOT return calls in a timely manner They do not tolerate changing appointments and play the I'm doing you a BIG favor if they do so  and if you need something are late they SEND YOU AWAY this just happened to me I jsut wanted a crummy prescription for an infection but noooo I was late though I called several times and begged the staff to work with me this is arrogance pure and simple if this is what you want go here they're fired ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_P_Hill html," Laura P Hill, ",Dr LAURA HILL is without a doubt the best doctor I've had in more than 70 years She's extremely knowledgeable intelligent helpful and concerned about her patients Amazing woman Can't find fault with her or her practice in any way ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Emmick html, Laura S Emmick ,Dr L E has great bedside manner and is a good listener and explainer I thought a bit about going to her given the last reviewer blaming her for weight gain related to an emotional disorder and medication prescribed for it  ridiculous I found the doscgor's assessment of my emotional issues thorough She helped me decide what side effects I was and was not willing to risk giving me the ultimate choice That's what a good doctor is supposed to do  tell us how it is and can be and let the patient decide what is best for their mind and body ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Emmick html, Laura S Emmick ,She has a very good bedside manner can be very caring compassionate & empathetic However there is one area I'm not very pleased with Medication  for areas she does not need to prescribe for until she's absolutely positive condition has been evaluated fully I feel a second opinion is wise before accepting not just her diagnosis but any physicians diagnosis Unfortunately due to her thinking I was well advanced in a particular emotional disorder the medication prescribed caused a very large wt gain that I haven't been able to lose in many yrs Other than that i rate her as a good physician ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Leisa_Maxwell html, Leisa L Maxwell ,Dr Maxwell is very efficient and caring The front desk staff however are rude and incompetent Her nurses are very good as well so I keep going to her but Takoma seems poorly run overall ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Leslie_Cronister html, Leslie C Caraceni ,Dr C saved my life and I love her for it She was a very caring doctor It doesn't matter anymore because of what's happened but she was often late to appointments at times I'd have waited for 2 hours for her or someone to show up The bigger issue was she put her trust in a couple assistants that used her to write scripts when they obviously shouldn't have These people are scum Even after her office closed they would use Facebook to try and steal people's money by offering to send in an RX Meg Renne and someone named Pamela really screwed her and her patients over They should be locked up and Dr C should be allowed to keep saving lives ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Leslie_Cronister html, Leslie C Caraceni ,In the beginning she was awesome Then she got these assistants and she kind of disappeared She had alot going on in her life Without her I wouldn't be where I am I honestly feel bad that all this happened I think she trusted the wrong people I really hope she is OK she truly cares about each of her patients ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Leslie_Cronister html, Leslie C Caraceni ,She just vanished out of thin air I gave the pharmacy my Rx to fill and they called me and told me the doctors license was not renewed so now I can't get my medication even though I've paid $220 for the office visit and no this isn't Meg ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Leslie_Cronister html, Leslie C Caraceni ,The reviewer that gave 1 star sounds like her employee she fired for stealing money pretending to be the doctor and selling prescriptions DR CARACENI is outstanding at what she does by far the best around for treatment of addiction I have been her patient for 7 years so i shoukd know I drive 2 hours to see her because its worth getting great care ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Leslie_Cronister html, Leslie C Caraceni ,She's never on time doesn't show up for hours after she's supposed to be there patience wait 5 or 6 hours to see her she's known as a pill Mill and she's being investigated by the DEA I do not recommend this doctor she's negligent she violates HIPAA she has people hooked on Suboxone that don't need to be on Suboxone just so she can collect their money she's greedy and she should not be a doctor Not to mention more than half the pharmacies will not accept her prescriptions because she's such a bad prescriber If you care about your recovery at all you will not go to this doctor,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Linya_Yang html, Linya Yang ,Dr Yang's scheduling practices and lack of compassion and flexibility surrounding them do not make her a good physician if you have a mental illness requiring medication ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucia_Dias-Hoff html, Lucia G Dias-Hoff ,There doesn't seem to be any communication between the Dr and the office girl I was told I needed to make an apt so I could get a lab sheet so I could take to the lab then make another apt to review the results Almost impossible to get a referral after multiple calls Still waiting for a prescription to be sent to the pharmacy 5 days with several calls and faxes from myself and the pharmacy I just switched to this Dr and was never once asked for files from my past Dr ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucia_Dias-Hoff html, Lucia G Dias-Hoff ,Never once was the doctor timely for any appointment It is almost as if her time is more important than yours As a working professional I find it rude However with the limited PCPs accepting new clients I am left with no choice to tolerate this behavior from my doctor ,3,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucia_Dias-Hoff html, Lucia G Dias-Hoff ,This Doctor does not care about her patients it's all about the all mighty dollar when it comes to care here I get no cooperation just asking to have a simple health care letter written for some one who has been her patient for 8 years requires an office visit She is unethical and should be in a another line of work The receptionist is rude as well,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucia_Dias-Hoff html, Lucia G Dias-Hoff ,Dr Dias Hoff took care of me in a very special way She was really caring and treated me as if i was a family member She treated me and took real good care of my back problems After this experience with her she will be my doctor for many years to come ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,My husband and I were both patients She put him on meds for hypertension with little discussion regarding the dangers of hypertension and the importance of the medication Turned out he was already in chronic kidney failure anyway but it wasn't diagnosed by Dr Vega Then when his new doctors tried to get his records it took months I began having a great deal of pain on my left side and went to her about it She sent me to a urologist to see if it was a kidney stone After a CT scan the urologist told me  There is a very small stone lodged in your left kidney but it's too small to be causing you pain so that isn't your source  I returned to Dr Vega and asked  Now what I really do have a lot of pain What else could it be  I'm not even joking when I say that she kind of looked at me blankly for a second then changed the subject and it was NEVER discussed again I had no answer and that was that I felt kind of foolish and wrong like maybe she thought I was crazy Being frustrated and a very busy mother of young children I forged on with life and the pain would go away for several months periodically and return again periodically Finally I had changed doctors when my husband did and I brought up the pain issue to him He sent me to a new urologist who discovered that the tiny stone was still lodged in the same spot but it was now almost a centimeter in size He tried blasting it but it was too large and he only managed to make it a little smaller Then that doctor retired and I let it be for a couple of years because I felt ok and was still super busy When the pain returned I went to a new urologist who found the stone to now be a centimeter and a half plus more stones to have developed all lodged in the same place I just recently had to go through surgery to remove all of them and it was discovered that my kidney has a deformity which causes this All this time All this pain All this money spent It's not that I fault her for not knowing this was where I was headed or this not being an area of expertise for her what I take issue with is the blank stare and complete dismissal of me I wasn't lying I really was in pain She did nothing ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,I have been a patient of doctor Vega for almost 10 years I am beyond thankful and happy that I am her patient Dr Vega is an intelligent and down to earth doctor She explains everything in simple language and detail I am an individual who needs to fully understand what is going on with my body Dr Vega always takes the time to explain any issues through words books diagrams and even hand drawn illustrations I feel that Dr Vega truly knows me as a person and I am not just a number in her client records Dr Vega is always available by a pager I have had to use this system a couple times in emergency cases and she always responds to my page and gets my concern straightened out Tammy the receptionist is great Some days she is very busy and conversation naturally cannot happen However many visits we talk and I feel that we know each other well The only complaint is that Dr Vega doesn't have a clone and she cannot service every individual I highly recommend her to everyone If you call always leave a message and you will be contacted back as soon as possible If you haven't been contacted then page her ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,The office is always clean I can usually get appointments quickly when I am sick Tammy the receptionist nice It is hard to get someone to answer the phone though You have to leave a message and wait for a call back If you miss the call it's difficult to get them back on the phone I will say that in the few times I have had to have tests run at another location I very rarely get them back I usually have to call several times to get any info and make an appointment Dr Vega is very nice and takes her time with you but I do feel that she is a little flighty Although I enjoy seeing her as a patient I think I am going to start looking for a new dr I don't feel that she follows up enough and isnt thorough enough Which is sad because I truly enjoy being her patient ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,I have been relying upon Dr Vega for about 11 years now and she is the absolute best doctor on planet earth My husband and I have called her countless times and she is ALWAYS available We consider ourselves fortunate to have such a great doctor and also a friend that takes extra time to listen to our concerns Also as a nurse I can attest to her outstanding care She deserves 5 stars ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,Tamara the receptionist is very rude & does NOT return phone calls promptly I stay only for Dr Vega ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,Dr Vega is the best Dr ever I been her patient for several years Very kind and sweet ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lucille_Vega html, Lucille C Vega ,Dr Vega's receptionist is VERY discourteous and might possibly be enough to send me somewhere else I have not yet been given my blood work results after 2 months because I can't take more time out of work for another appointment and they refuse to tell me in any way other than that Have been charged for something I didn't need and now can't get a call back from the doctor to discuss ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,Dr Bennett is a good Dr She works with you to figure out the problem and suggests the most effective method to take care of the problem She is very cost conscious and is knowledgeable about remedies and meds that can be purchased for a lesser amount She is a quiet calm person who is encouraging as well ,4,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,I found her to be very condescending and not interested in what I had to say about my health ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,all computerized information no real talk or real conversation dry personality ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,I've never had a problem with Dr Bennett or her office She is very kind knowledgeable and responds to the patient needs Anytime I needed them referral for a doctor I anytime I needed them referral for a doctor I received it She's a very smart woman Yeah not many practices in Bedford for women to go to that want to be part of the Elliott ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,Dr Bennett is fantastic One of the best Doctors that I have ever had ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,Dr Bennett is Incompetent and disingenuous She does the bare minimum in trying to problem solve and then all but gives up and makes you feel as though you are making up symptoms when she can quickly identify the problem Due to her and her staff having less than ideal bedside manner/ability to communicate I took to email in which they were even more unprofessional It does not appear that she is this field to truly care for her patients If she is than she really needs to look at what she is doing and make some changes so more patients don't have a similar experience ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,She would prescribe medication and when a refill was needed she would not refill it This would occur after I was on it for a year or more This happened on 4 occasions It made me feel like I was begging for medication instead I went thru horrible withdrawals Office records are inaccurate She appears forgetful and inept My young son suddenly passed away Her associates prescribed a small amount of anti anxiety medication I had to keep calling in for refills She refused to get back to me and again would not refill the prescription i had to go to another doctor to get medication She is NOT my doctor any longer ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,Terrible practice would never go there again Overcharges incompetent secretaries ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Lydia_Bennett html, Lydia B Bennett ,I went to this women 3 times in 2 months and each time I went she asked me what Dr I was seeing I had to tell her it WAS her Now 10 months later she just asked me if she had ever seen me even with all the info in front of her I won't go into all the of other things which made my blood boil and had me leaving there shaking my head after each visit ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,Negative attitude from the outset She's always rushed but really doesn't do anything in clinic Wants specialists to write all prescriptions Doesn't follow up Poor PCP Dumped her fast ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,Insensitive and non caring physician Perhaps she is very good at what she does but as a healthcare provider I see compassion and maybe a bit of a common sense in etiquette are as important as competency in physical medical care ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,She just really seems to be more concerned with getting me in and out of the office as quick as possible She also answers questions with a this is how it usually happens  instead of listening to my personal concerns or past experiences I feel like I am something for her to check off her list for the day and not a person ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,I have had Dr Phan as my physician for a few years now and she just doesn't seem to care very much about her patients Whenever I talk to her it seems like she is just trying to get me out of the office as quickly as possible When I had severe menstrual cramps once I told her about it and how I even ended up passing out  my first time passing out  from the pain she was very nonchalant and didn't offer any solutions I would not recommend her ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,Cautious with medications Correct diagnosis of serious illness Readily available ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,Dr Phan has been my PCP for many years  at least 8  Since I am generally in good health I do not see her frequently However whenever I do she is very sweet  for example always inquiring about my children  She has been accurate in diagnosing and treating me The office is clean and very professional ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,My wife and I have seen her because our regular doctor was booked She assumes the best case scenario for illnesses no matter how severe the symptoms may be She seems overly conservative to such a degree that she would be protected from misdiagonisis No diagnosis = no possibility of MISdiagnosis,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mai_Phan html, Mai T Phan ,Dr Phan was on call the day I needed assistance over the phone and she was completely rude and made me feel like an idiot She kept telling me what I was doing wrong when I ended up being the middle man between a mis communication among doctors and she rushed to a decision It seemed like she just wanted to get off the phone and stop dealing with me from the beginning She didn't even introduce herself as the doctor when she called and there was a long silence and when I started explaining the situation she interrupted me and it just kept going downhill from there If you are considering this doctor I would suggest someone else I can only imagine what she would be like in a more serious situation and I would avoid her at all costs ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Manoj_Garg html, Manoj K Garg ,All of my family had gone to Dr Garg since 2004 ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Manoj_Garg html, Manoj K Garg ,I have been a patient of Doctor Garg's for almost 5 years now and all I can say is that I wish I had found him sooner He is the most patient Doctor and will always find time to talk to you and listen to your concerns and talk to you and make sure you understand everything I actually look forward to seeing him when I have an appoitment because he is just such a good person to talk to and always makes you feel better when leaving ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Manoj_Garg html, Manoj K Garg ,Dr Garg is an excellent doctor and a very sweet person He always takes the time to listen ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Manuela_Mendes html, Manuela M Mendes ,I have to say I don't believe her qualified to be practicing medicine Overall very unprofessional I believe that she has stereotyped many of her patients because they are mainly Portuguese Their is no objectivity in her medical practicing methods its like one size fits all Besides lacking up to date medical expertise she also lacks in easing patients psychologically I would not recommend her to anyone In my opinion she should not be a medical doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Manuela_Mendes html, Manuela M Mendes ,Dr Mendes is a very caring and understanding dr She stays on top of all your problems and doesn't give up until your absolutely feelintg better or heeled I would recommend her to anyone who wants to be treated with great respect dedication and professionalism ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marc_Sopher html, Marc D Sopher ,Dr Sopher was our family physician from 1990 until he closed his practice in 2010 ish This included my one son as a toddler and a new born infant In 2012 we moved to another state I have yet to find another Dr as good Fyi he caught my husbands thyroid problem in a physical exam The specialists in Boston were surprised he caught it because it was not very pronounced ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marc_Sopher html, Marc D Sopher ,Dr Sopher has been my PCP for 10 years or more He is intelligent and personable He has accurately assessed my health conditions and performed what I consider to be reasonable treatment as needed I would recommend him to others ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marcelo_Campos html, Marcelo C Campos ,No doubt that Harvard Vanguard is a very business oriented institute in which rather than the quality of care it is focused on how much more money they can make off of each individual patient Honestly do not know how DR Campus has become a doctor I showed up at his office with a torn ACL and he did not realize the injury that the second doctor I visited found out within 5 minutes He even left the room in the middle of our conversation when I was describing that there is something wrong with my knee Instead of referring me to an orthopedic surgeon he wanted me to do physical therapy [at Harvard Vanguard to spend some more money] It appears that all his knowledge is off of the software he uses at the office which is apparently making lots of errors Do not go to Harvard Vanguard and if you end up there do NOT choose Campos,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marcelo_Campos html, Marcelo C Campos ,Dr Campos makes patients feel very comfortable asking any questions and fosters a spirit of partnership in managing one's care He is mindful to explain things in patient friendly language doesn't make you feel rushed and is very accessible Highly recommend him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marcelo_Campos html, Marcelo C Campos ,Dr Campos is a great doctor Very nice always smiling easy to connect He took the time to go over my previous records and also to get to know about me as a person Sometimes I feel like I am just numbers in the computer I would strongly recommend him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marcia_Tanur html, Marcia V Tanur ,Its time for this person to retire Made my wife cry she was so mean,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marcia_Tanur html, Marcia V Tanur ,Worst bedside manner I have ever experienced Condinsending arrogant and verbally abusive I would not allow her to taxidermy my deceased gerbil ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Margaret_Shelly html, Margaret E Shelly ,Dr Shelly is one of my favorite things about Boston She handles all her patients individually and personally Her naturally pleasant demeanor encourages discussion about not just treatment and preventive care but also a fully understanding of any injuries or conditions for a more precise and appropriate treatment I really like her a lot ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Margaret_Shelly html, Margaret E Shelly ,I normally don't write reviews but thought my experience with Dr Shelly required it I had been a patient of Dr Shelley for about 2 years I didn't have any problems with her until I needed more medical attention than a PCP could provide When I needed an emergency appointment for a kidney stone  it was misdiagnosed as a urinary infection but that's a common misdiagnosis  she had just gone on vacation There is supposed to be a backup doctor for such instances but she does not have one I then had to go to a health clinic who sent me to the ER What followed were a number of doctor visits The first few were out of my network  due to the emergency  and I needed backdated referals  this was a nightmare to get I was first told that all I needed were the doctor's ID number but then she wanted me to have the doctors call her  not common  On top of that she doesn't have a regular receptionist to answer phone calls or figure out problems and Doctor Shelly is not the easiest of people to talk to when there's a problem outside of medicine In addition to that when she got back from vacation I was told I needed to go back to a network doctor she sent me to a kidney stone specialist rather than a urologist further delaying my needed surgery by another week Bottom line if you have Dr Shelly as a PCP opt for the PPO plan rather than the HMO plan ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Margaret_Shelly html, Margaret E Shelly ,The Good: Easy to get an appointment She has a newbury street office which is convenient to get to The Bad: She never spend more than 2 minutes with each patients She doesn't allow you to have more than two things to talk about at each visit She does an aweful and horrible papsmear test She doesn't remember you and why you are here  even though it is a follow up appointment  She doesn't explain the medication or disease to the full detail as every patient deserve to hear She is recentful to send you to a specialist even if she herself is helpless to your situation the list can go on and goIn Summary:She is the most careless and irresponsible doctor I have ever had She is trying to see as many patients as possible per day and spend the least amount of time with each If you don't want your treatment to get delayed don't see this doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Margaret_Shelly html, Margaret E Shelly ,She is wonderful and has always taken all the time that I have needed She really cares and listens She is very up to date on medical care I travel from the South Shore to see her I have always been able to get an appointment on short notice and have also been able to get her on the phone Several of my friends also go to her,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Margaret_Shelly html, Margaret E Shelly ,I'd have like her to spend a little more time with me not just walk in ask me a question and then start walking me out I think she only sees people for 5 8 mins does not give a chance to let her know your problem ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Maria_Boylan html, Maria T Boylan ,Dr Boylan is fantastic She is easy to talk to listens remembers things about me visit to visit She is smart and thorough She tries to avoid overtesting and overprescribing She does her own procedures in office also cares for prenatal patients and great with my children ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Maria_Boylan html, Maria T Boylan ,Dr Boylan listened to all my concerns She explained everything so well to me She is truly invested in my care ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Maria_Boylan html, Maria T Boylan ,She just seemed so cold and too busy to hear any of my concerns I was just a number to her I had to go back to a different doctor to actually find out what was going on Stay clear of this one ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marichi_Ong html, Marichi O Ong ,thorough efficient explained well,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marichi_Ong html, Marichi O Ong ,explained well thorough compassionate knowledgable,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marichi_Ong html, Marichi O Ong ,I am in the process of searching for a new primary care provider because Marichi Ong is the worst I've had I'm 25 healthy not a smoker drinker or have any emotional handicaps What should be regular checkups are actually her somehow making me feel unhealthy and questioning anything I say She did routine bloodwork and one test came back higher in something that I had to look up myself as havjng to do with possible liver damage There should be no reason for tbis but she didn't go on to ask about family history or reorder the test No She sent me to have colon surgery At 24 I likely do not have anything wrong with my liver I've never had a problem with any other doctor My OB is great Now i have to find myself a new PCP because she can't just ask about diet family history actually figure out if something is wrong before ordering surgery on someone with no previous health problems ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marichi_Ong html, Marichi O Ong ,Love her,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marie_Walsh_Condon html, Marie T Walsh Condon ,I have been to a few primary care practices associated with Winchester Hospital & had not been impressed with the care given by the providers I decided to go a little out of the way and try the Medford practice I choose Marie Walsh Condon as my primary care and could not be happier with the decision I find her to be very thorough and caring She has a good bedside manner and gets back to you quickly with test results She seems to really enjoy what she does and is always pleasant and upbeat I have no hesitation in recommending her she takes very good care of her patients It is important to her and it shows ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marie_Walsh_Condon html, Marie T Walsh Condon ,She was very nice and I felt very comfortable with her ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,I have been a patient of Dr Bochman for over 15 years She has scheduled me for tests which revealed serious problems She schedules follow up appointments and asks relevant questions ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,Cannot in good conscience recommend this physician If you care about your health at all please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,We lived in Hamilton for twenty five years and when we relocated to Vermont the only thing that my husband and I realized we could not replicate or substitute were our primary care providers Dr Bochman is an amazing person and an excellent  beyond excellent actucally  physician The personalized care we have received over twenty plus years starts with Cindy and the other wonderful phone and check in/check out staff extends to nurses June Jean Jaime and Marilyn and the lab as well a two and a half hour drive is not something we take lightly but it gives us peace of mind to remain with this amazing care team ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,I've been a grateful and lucky patient of Dr Bochman's for over a decade She is professional yet warm and empathetic She is careful meticulous and pragmatic which is incredibly helpful in a confusing healthcare environment I would   and do   recommend her to family friends etc ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,grateful and glad to be followed by a physician with a caring and empathetic manner This doctor takes time to thoroughly respond to all concerns ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,When I first started seeing Dr Bochman several years ago I was extremely impressed with her caring and patient demeanor Most recently however over the past 3 5 appointments she has been rude condescending impatient and invalidating For example during my last appointment she negated and undermined all of my complaints blatantly failing to take the time to listen She told me that I didn't appear to be suffering or in pain  I was in tears  Despite spending a total of about 10 minutes with me she coded the visit as Level 4 She couldn't be bothered to follow up with me I should also note that if I hadn't spoken up to one of nurses and had followed her previous treatment as prescribed I very likely would've died due to a fatal drug drug interaction she carelessly overlooked Thanks to my medical background I am able to advocate for myself but I truly fear for the the life of the average patient/consumer with little or no medical knowledge It saddens me to see how her level of compassion and competence as a physician has declined so notably After my last appointment I left in tears vowing to find a new Primary Care Provider immediately I absolutely could *NOT* in good conscience recommend this physician ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,I'm sorry I moved from Massachusetts because I've yet to find a doctor as caring and smart as she She always sat down and took the time to talk to me as a person I've a sister w/breast cancer and she always took extra care to investigate any ovarian cysts I might've had to make sure it wasn'nt ovarian cancer  as there's a link between b c and o c  ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marissa_Fernandez_Kiemele html, Marissa C Fernandez Kiemele ,I cannot have enough words of gratitude for Dr Fernandez She was perfect for me I felt valued It is so unfortunate that the Gig Harbor Clinic closed It was an administrative decision not hers She'd never take $70 and run ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,After avoiding and distrusting doctors for many years I finally chose Dr Rosenberg for a long overdue checkup I had met him at a walk in urgent care  and my initial contact with him had indicated that he was a caring and respectful professional who did not force his patients to do anything that made them uncomfortable Dr Rosenberg diagnosed a problem that I had apparently had for some time and that requires surgery He was caring thorough and professional  until I asked for a referral to a specialist at Mass General Hospital  which  based on previous experience  is the only place that I will feel comfortable having surgery Dr Rosenberg informed me that he was faxing my records to a local hospital that I did not want to go to  and he refused to assist me in finding a doctor a Mass General I was surprised and very disappointed In any event I found my own doctor at Mass General  and it is a whole different world up there I can assure you I expected much better from Dr Rosenberg in that regard ,4,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,Treated me with no respect Would not listen to what I had to say and stated I was depressed After finding the right doctor I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,Dr Rosenberg is a great doctor I am a healthy 24 year old male and play tennis 4 times a week He was able to give me some advice on how to avoid injury and deal with soreness or inflammation The only area I feel could have improved is wait time  45min  Hour  however being that I have only been one time it could have been a rare occurrence ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,I love Dr Rosenberg he takes care of my entire family Anytime I need an appointment I can get one I have a short wait He is definaltly a down to earth doctor that I can talk to about anything I would and have recommended him to friends ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,dr rosenberg is a good doctor but like most american doctors he is never in the front office so he has no idea how rude his staff can be and the older woman working there can be quite rude how rude after standing at the sliding glass reception window for several *minutes* once i finally tapped on the glass and the woman said  i'm finishing this  not even looking up while she continued working on the computer the 2 younger women standing behind her ignored me too when she finally opened the window she said  gimmee your insurance card  i only encounter this level of rudeness consistently in doctors' offices and i've concluded that it has to be because most doctors feel really uncomfortable with the business end of doctoring  so they really don't care what happens in the front office and it shows i am looking for a new doctor with a professional staff but i can't say that i'm confident i will find one ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,Excellent doctor Listens to me My whole family sees him including my kids and they love him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_J_Rosenberg html, Mark A Rosenberg ,I feel very fortunate to have found a doctor and office staff as caring and attentive as the ones here I would highly recommend this practice to everyone I meet ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,The best compassionate caring truly concerned,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,What kind of doctor complains to a patient for not following up for additional care after a diagnosis because your health insurance company will give him bad marks which is their way of trying to pay doctors less ARE YOU KIDDING ME  Mind you the doctors office didnt call to remind patient to follow up or have patient schedule needed follow ups while in the office Dr Reeder is an arrogant jerk who care more about his paycheck than his patients COMPLETELY DISGUSTED ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,This Dr needs a reality check Never on time Never knows why your there Done with him ',2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,Avoid Dr Redder at all costs,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,DR Reeder runs late majority of the time I have had the first appointment available and have waited up to 45 mins for him to come in I was his first appointment of the day When he generally appears he never knows what there for he take about 5 mins reading his lap top It so frustrating dealing with him The women at the front desk is so very rude I called to reschedule appointment and she sighed so heavily on the other end you think I asked for her left kidney I am so done with this place and Dr Reeder  I am surprised he still has a practice at all ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,Dr Reeder is Great He is a friendly guy who seems to truly care about the people he cares for His office staff although sometimes nice are very difficult to work with They are impossible to get a hold of They do not call you back if you leave a message They do not fill prescriptions in a timely manner when they are phoned in The worst part is that it seems like Dr Reeder has no idea this is happening His business is being run terribly by his staff I have a prescription that needs to be mailed to me monthly and on several occasions after I have called it in the staff has simply not told Dr Reeder So a week goes by and I call to see the status and they say it's in the process I stop in to pick it up and they told me it was in the mail Now almost 3 weeks has gone by since I called and I receive the prescription in the mail only to see that the post office stamp date on the envelope is for 2 days ago They completely lied to me about getting the prescription signed and mailed out Only after I stopped by the office did they get serious and have my prescription written This is an awful way to treat customers in any business never mind health care where people's health and lives are at risk ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Reeder html, Mark L Reeder ,Great Doctor and staff One of the few doc's that I trust with my life ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_L_Timmerman html, Mark L Timmerman ,The actual doctors are extremely understanding courteous and experienced The staff of the office is the complete opposite The secretary that works every time I have been in is one of the rudest most judgemental people I have ever experienced ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_L_Timmerman html, Mark L Timmerman ,The doctor and nurses and PA's at this practice are caring and knowledgeable I especially liked Carol I left this office not because of the care It was due to the secretary It seems that whenever I had to get a referral  the referral was not put through This has happened repeatedly I did tell my Doctor that I did not see the physician he referred me to was because I couldn't seem to get the actual referral from his own office to do so Upon hearing that I got the referral right away Yet this continued to happen I contacted the office manager but have not heard from them as of yet I want them to know why I left If there is a patient with a serious illness like cancer or something and they had to wait weeks for a referral because the secretary is too busy they need to know about this Even if it is not an emergency this should not happen ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_L_Timmerman html, Mark L Timmerman ,I like a lot of things about this practice but I hate the wait I have to endure every time I go there If it's not waiting in the waiting room it's waiting in one of the exam rooms There has been a couple of times where I waited an hour before seeing anyone On the flip side Dr Timmerman is a wonderful doctor  full of knowledge and I believe he truly cares for his patients His diagnosis is accurate This is why I continue to go there ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_L_Timmerman html, Mark L Timmerman ,I have been a patient at this office for 20+ years I have been seen by dr Timmerman as well as his associate Carol Landon They always take more time with you than any other office I have been to Very through and listen to your feedback I especially like them having a blood lab in the office Referrals are easy to receive refills are handled the same day ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_L_Timmerman html, Mark L Timmerman ,I have been a patient of Dr Timmerman's for 10 years now my only complaint really is that he is always running behind I don't mean 15 minutes but I have waited for 2 hours to be seen once He does take time with me and never rushes but it can take 1/2 my day when I have an appointment with him ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Bright html, Mark T Bright ,If it were not for my grief this not so Bright bulb would have been sued He pumped my sister full of medicines to keep her out of his hair I am a healthcare practitioner and quite aware of his treatment of my sister who had a history of head injuries and mental illness She had a sudden death related to the amount of medication he continuously ordered Sadly there was no autopsy Stay clear or go to a Vet ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Bright html, Mark T Bright ,Great Doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Bright html, Mark T Bright ,Have been a patient of Dr Bright since 1986 Have nothing but good things to say about the level of care provided He was also my daughters pediatrician and is still a patient at 20yrs old ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Bright html, Mark T Bright ,He argued with me that I was gaining weight based on looking at my last two visits on my chart where I had gained 1/2 pound He didn't want to hear that I had lost 20 pounds in the previous year He wrote a date down a card and handed it to me with no explanation and left He gave me something to take to the lab they had no idea what it was He rolled his eyes when I told him what my last doctor said He really listened to nothing I said or explained anything He complained about Obama though out of the Blue what a loser ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Bright html, Mark T Bright ,Doctor Bright in my opinion is an excellant doctor He spends as much time with a patient as is needed and also completely answers all questions that my wife and I have at each appointment He also cares enough to spend time after office hours to research whatever problem we have to be sure it is being treated properly I not only would but have recommended him to family and friends ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mark_Bright html, Mark T Bright ,great dr very thorough long wait and tough to get appt when sick ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marla_Onishi html, Marla J Onishi ,My visit was at the walk in clinic but she and her staff have followed up in a very tinely manner and referred me for tests and then referred me for a follow up visit to a specialist ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marla_Onishi html, Marla J Onishi ,I know the wait time interferes with her rating but she spends as much time as needed with me This prob means she spends as much time as needed with others could increase wait time for her I dont mind will wait with no probs or hard feelings ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marla_Onishi html, Marla J Onishi ,Had to be the biggest waste of time and money paying to see this doctor Ended up having to pay another copay to see another doctor Does not seem to be very intelligent with certain health problems and her bedside manner is lacking ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marla_Onishi html, Marla J Onishi ,Dr Onishi is my entire families Dr We all love her My parents are elderly and she always takes time with us answers all of our questions and is great at following up with us She is very easy to talk to about anything I would and have recommended her to all my friends and family I hope she never retires I can't imagine going to another Dr ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marla_Onishi html, Marla J Onishi ,Best doctor i have ever met i would definately recomend herto anyone she is very thorough and caring,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marney_Roemmelt html, Marney D Roemmelt ,I have seen Dr Roemmelt since she filled in for my regular doctor in 2003 I immediately switched over to her care Dr Roemmelt likes to try nat ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marney_Roemmelt html, Marney D Roemmelt ,Very kind Highly recommended ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marney_Roemmelt html, Marney D Roemmelt ,This dr might need more training in primary care as well as inegrative medicine She seems to be lacking solid knowledge and experience in both categories She does spend lots of time with you but it is reflected in charts as face to face counseling  which I don't know if this remark looks bad or good for the patient ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marney_Roemmelt html, Marney D Roemmelt ,She Is Awesome ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marney_Roemmelt html, Marney D Roemmelt ,I appreciate that Dr Roemmelt offers a balance between Eastern and Western medical practices She is far and away the most caring clinician I have ever encountered She treats the whole patient and  at least in my case  trusts the patient as the best source of information about the patient's health and well being ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marney_Roemmelt html, Marney D Roemmelt ,the most caring and knowledgeable integrative doctor ever ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,My first meeting with Dr Onyskiv for a physical I was barely looked at by her as if she didn't even want to give me the time of day I get that people can have bad or off days but she obviously wanted to get out of the room as fast as possible First physical and she didn't even examine me or look at me or ask anything about my medical history I did not feel like I could even express concern if I had any due to her being very dismissive ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,I'm honestly at a loss for words about my experience today with Dr Onyskiv My regular primary care doctor was not in the office so I scheduled an appointment with Dr Onyskiv Her lack of care and compassion for a patient who came to her for professional medical advice was appalling I would normally never write a bad review about the way I was treated at an establishment or business because I know everyone can have an off or bad day This was in no way the situation with Marta She is clearly in the wrong profession I feel sorry for any patient that seeks out advice or help from her and leaves in tears feeling as though you were a waste of her precious time ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,The worst doctors appointment I have ever had in my life Went in for script refills and mentioned nausea I've been having and explained I think it's just stress related Did a two second examination and started pushing into my stomach in different places  I know this is normal  and I told her a few times that no it did not hurt She then I might have a gallstone I asked her what it was and she would give me one word answers I later talked to a nurse and found out that that she jumped to the most ridiculous conclusion possible Would not give me any time would be answering questions while already halfway out the door and trying to leave After being booked for a ultrasound at a hospital because they don't own one I cried on the way home because i had no idea what was going on Atrocious ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,If you call Marta Onyskiv's office to leave a prescription refill THEY WILL NEVER CALL YOU BACK Regardless if you just got out out the er or in need of medication The front desk staff will put you on hold for ten minutes and more  and to them that is a brief hold  I should of known not to go to her because of bad reviews But she was close and I suggest you not to She don't seem professional at all She do not thoroughly examine you for anything She will give you medicine for refills and call it a day And she will not schedule an appointment to follow up with the sickest patient Isn't that wonderful ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,I'll start off by saying that I've given this doctor multiple chances I realize everyone is human and has bad days however after this last appointment I will never go back to Dr Onyskiv's office ever again It seems every day is is bad day to her She's unprofessional and makes you feel like you are wasting her time I highly recommend finding another healthcare provider ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,She is a smart and caring doctor After 4 years of having a few tough unanswered questions which no one else would or could address concerning my elderly mother she solved these two chronic problems I am grateful to her ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,alwas happy to see Marta she always hepls ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marta_Onyskiv html, Marta Onyskiv ,My son was 5 months old when Dr Onyskiv was my son's doctor She said that he had a bulge in his groin area and that over time it will go away Obviously it didn't because when he was 3 years old his bulge was still there I went to see a pediatrician who said he has a hernia and it's been there ever since he was born He had surgery and the hernia was fixed I believe she didn't know what she was doing at all ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martha_Mcloughlin html, Martha H Mcloughlin ,Dr McLoughlin was great efficient and thorough ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Devine html, Martin D Devine ,He has been my sons doctor for over half his life and my daughters doctor her entire life taking her as a patient right from the hospital after she was born He has been an amazing doctor and my children They love him and trust him and know they can talk to him about anything DR Devine has such a crazy case load because he is so wonderful at what he does but he still took my grandson as a patient again right from the hospital because my son didn't want any other doctor but Dr Devine caring for his first born He has the best bed side manner as well and the way he deals with the kids and talks to them and listens is great My daughter talks to him about school grades and anything that is bothering her because she knows he will help her in any way he can HE IS THE BEST ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Devine html, Martin D Devine ,The most thing I like about Dr Devine is that he takes his time with you He never rushes you He answers all of your questions Makes you feel so comfortable The only thing I don't like it takes a long time to get appointment  because he's so busy but I guess that's comes along with being a GREAT doctor It's worth the wait ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Devine html, Martin D Devine ,Dr Devine has been my Dr for 14 years and he is absolutely a wonderful doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Devine html, Martin D Devine ,I have had Dr Devine for many as our Family doctor He is caring and understands our needs with every visit He saved my life and I will always be grateful as well as my family He keeps his promises and knows how to make things work He holds a special place in my and my familys hearts He is the best and a true Doctor It was serendipity ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Kerzer html, Martin J Kerzer ,I have been seeing Dr Kerzer as my primary doctor for over 30 years He is the best doctor and I'm glad to have him He takes extremely good care of me He always cares about how I am doing asks me to send him an e mail after surgeries and always sends me to the best specialists when I need one He does run a bit behind on his appointments but he's worth the wait ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Kerzer html, Martin J Kerzer ,I have been going to APCM/Dr Kerzer for about 20 years and highly recommend this practice They explain things in English spend enough time and are very accommodating if you have an urgent need Although Dr Kerzer is my primary doctor I would also like to give kudos to Julie Rousseau nurse practitioner as well as the rest of their staff A+ to all ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Kerzer html, Martin J Kerzer ,I've been seeing Dr Kerzer for several years now after my father had seen him for more than twenty I can see why my father was with him so long he's a great doc and I'm glad to have him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Kerzer html, Martin J Kerzer ,First of all I waited 2 HOURS to see Dr Kerzer for the first time I waited all this time in agony being so ill just for this doctor to tell me he HIGHLY doubts I'll ever find out what's wrong with me  that wasn't the only time he stated this   He could've at least pretended to care to listen and actually wrote down some of the important information I was telling him He then said to Get over it and move on with my life I was so beyond disgusted and hurt by this I will never go back and so I continued my search for a compassionate professional and knowledgeable doctor and 2 months later I've been diagnosed with 3 illnesses Don't waste your time and your money on someone that doesn't care for their patients ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Martin_Kerzer html, Martin J Kerzer ,I first saw Dr Kerzer when I moved into the area and needed a new doctor I wasn't expecting much and maybe thought it was just a placeholder but that was 12 years ago My health always feels like his top priority when I see him and I can't count the number of times he's improved my life over the years ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Lyster html, Mary E Lyster ,I went with my husband to his first appointment with Dr Lyster because he has been having a problem with nightmares and acting out his dreams to the point of becoming violent falling out of bed flailing arms and legs etc After listening to me for a couple of minutes she stood up opened the door to the examining room & gestured for me to leave Very unprofessional and rude She never ordered or suggested a sleep study She just ordered routine blood work and said come back in 6 months We will be looking for another dr ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Lyster html, Mary E Lyster ,spent more time and listened better than any other doctor asked about my total health diet exercise emotional  physical family job the absolute most complete physical I ever had let me now that was in charge of my health care,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Lyster html, Mary E Lyster ,Even if she seems to listen to what you tell her she does not seem to make any effort to use that information and come up with any diagnostic or advice Ended the visit by asking me twice  like a salesman  if there was anything else she could help me with after she pretty much did not even order any lab tests to diagnose my symptoms  abdominal pain and bloatedness and extreme fatigue  and instead she just said it must be from stress and I should see a psychiatrist for depression Also it was flu season when I saw her and she did not even suggest I get a vaccine Good thing that one of the nurses asked me as I was getting out the door if I wanted one ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Lyster html, Mary E Lyster ,fantastic=smart listens compassionate,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Lyster html, Mary E Lyster ,after 20 years of taking pain killers for muscle aches Dr Lyster diagnosed me in one visit Why because she listened without having one hand on the prescription pad and the other on the door I am now pain free off narcotics and being followed by a specialist for a rare condition  myopathy  ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Lyster html, Mary E Lyster ,This doctor never spent one second trying to know me as a person Treated me like a naughty child for taking prescription meds prescribed by her predecessor I will not see her again ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Sherlock html, Mary E Sherlock ,This Doctor is for you if you don't mind waiting far past your appointment time after checking in with her rude ignorant staff Also perfect doctor for you if you want to be steered in the direction to four other doctors because that's what she does instead of finding a solution to the problem herself Honestly public keep searching ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Mary_Sherlock html, Mary E Sherlock ,Took forever to get in because the receptionist screwed up twice First they put me in for the wrong date so I had to reschedule then when I got there I had to wait for over an hour because instead of booking for me they booked with another patient with a similar name Apparently it takes over an hour to fix the confusion and be seen The kicker TWICE not once but TWICE she prescribed me medication that interacts with something else I take She wasn't at all helpful I don't recommend her ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Michael_C_Wu_3 html, Michael C Wu ,While this doctor helped me in so many ways in my personal opinion he was very lax when it came to Prostate Cancer Screening I was a patient of his for 2 years and he NEVER performed a DRE on me only PSA testing My scores were always normal but that was because of a severe hormonal imbalance After 2 years I went for my 2nd check up and reminded him that he never gave me a DRE  Digital Rectal Exam  in over 2 years He did this time and discovered a lump After the biopsy it was discovered that I was in Stage II Prostate Cancer Perhaps if he had performed the DRE sooner I would not have progressed to Stage II I left NH to be treated in La Jolla's UC San Diego's world renowned facility I find NH doctors to be far inferior to those of CA including the urologist who wanted to remove the gland That was not the case here in CA The treatment that was not suggested was the one used here in San Diego Make sure you go to Boston to get a second or even third opinion Leaving NH was the best decision that I ever made You could even say it was a matter of life and death ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Michael_C_Wu_3 html, Michael C Wu ,I have been a patient of Dr Wu's for nearly 4 years I consider myself extremely blessed to call myself one of his patients I am 65 years old and have had many doctors in my life but never one with the qualities of this man He takes all the time I need treats me as though I am his only patient that day He is highly intelligent he listens and considers everything I share with him and has a compassionate heart I only hope he stays in New Hampshire as I would be hard pressed to find another doctor like him I hold him in the highest regard and would recommend him without hesitation ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Michael_C_Wu_3 html, Michael C Wu ,The diagnoses he did on me was wrong I had a little rush on my skin on the hand and he described me virginal untivirus cream Also I told him that I have allergy and he without Testing the diagnos gave me asthma for asthma I paid for that and when i understood that everything is wrong what he prescribed me I made a visit him again He appologies and he said that I can keep this virginal cream in case I will need ot I was shocked that he tell me that He did not even care that I paid for that from my packet and his office charged me for that visit Horrible He did not solve his mistakes It may be okay for cream but if it would be some serious medication ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Moushumi_Mozumder html, Moushumi Mozumder ,I don't understand how other reviews are rated so high I found her to be condescending and not very interested in what ails me I left the practice My prior doctor moved and I started seeing Dr Muzumder From the very first meeting I wasn't impressed My yearly physical was probably one of the fastest I've ever had and she was more concerned with blood test results instead of me She made decisions based solely on ONE blood test And finally the foods she consumed each visit smells terrible It comes through her pores Each visit I couldn't wait to get out ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Moushumi_Mozumder html, Moushumi Mozumder ,Doctor Mozumder changed my life for the better in just two scheduled appointments After over 10 years of countless different doctors useless appointments with no accurate diagnosis endless stress and frustration from getting nowhere with my overall health and lack of proper/ethical medical treatment Dr Mozumder listened and questioned the symptoms I was having pointing me in the right direction to finally get the proper testing and appointments with doctors in specalized fields that I needed I am still undergoing testing and working with my new team of doctors monitored by Dr mozumder in order to pinpoint the specific treatment I need in order to function regularly on a day to day basis Dr Mosumder did in 2 hours what over 10 years of numerous doctors and specalists could not For this I thank her and will NEVER forget the care effort review and follow up she put into helping me on my painful journey to diagnosis Thank you Dr Mozumder,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nadia_Khan_2 html, Nadia H Khan ,She cuts visits short she told me I had depression and tried to convince me I needed to take pills even though I was just being abused in almost every way one could be abused I've been to a psychologist I don't have depression or any mental disorder Dr Khan ignored obvious signs of severe mental and physical abuse She lied to me about my X rays saying they showed early signs of arthritis if that was true how would it be possible for specialists to tell me a few years later that my spine has worse osteoarthritis than anyone they've seen under 65 and the worst anyone's ever seen on anyone who hasn't been in multiple serious accidents The only accident I had was having an extremely abusive mother and a list of drs that never cared to help me when I told them I was in pain One time Dr Khan was out sick when I had an appt so I had a very short overweight Doctor from Dartmouth Hitchcock Fill in for her and accuse me of doing cocaine because I was an underweight teenager never once was I asked if my mother fed me properly Needless to say I was rude to that dr ran home crying and never went back again until I wanted my medical records which Dartmouth Hitchcock conveniently lost all vaccination medical records and even all the X rays that belonged to me that could and would prove their gross negligence ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I've been Dr Keyes' patient for over 10 years I always feel like she spends plenty of time with me asking questions and the visits don't feel rushed I also like how she doesn't make a big deal out of something before knowing for sure if it's something to be concerned about ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I have been seeing Dr Keyes for at least 8 years and consider her one of the best doctors I have ever seen I love her bedside manner and NEVER seem rushed ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I drew Dr Keys out of the hat for my primary care physician For a non native speaker her command of American English is truly excellent She was good enough to refer me to specialists in order to guarantee that I had the best possible diagnoses and treatment Unlike other physicians she has never once suggested that I 'just get over myself' She considers my opinions of treatments and medications and we come to decisions together I don't think that I have ever had a better personal physician ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I have been going to Dr Keys for years sometimes I am not sure why I have different experiences every time I go to see her sometimes she is very moody and cold like and I feel like she puts me down about my weight the way she tells me to loose weight etc I ask her questions about my health and she will refer me to someone else most of the time I ask her to do a pap smear and she tells me to go to the gynecologist but I don't understand if I am there for a physical that why can't I just get it all done at once I don't know if its me or not but I feel like she is not checking into me enough about my health or giving me answers to make me feel sure I am ok about whatever it is I also try to ask her questions and she tells me to go to a psychiatrist to get medicine for anxiety but I get anxiety I think from her facial expressions like she is going to tell me I have something wrong with me I am confused on how I feel about her I eventually plan to look for a new Dr when I get around to it Most of the time she has this look on her face like she hates her job I sometimes but not all the time she can be friendly I have mixed emotions about her and feel that I may get better care from another Dr ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I was very surprised to read the other reviews because I've found Dr Keyes to be an excellent doctor When I was looking for a primary care physician Dr Keyes was suggested by a surgeon I know and I'm very happy to have chosen her When my gynecologist moved away I decided to have Dr Keyes do my yearly exams because I like her so much She seems very caring and attentive to me She's occasionally a little rushed but I think that's due to the number of patients that are crammed into her schedule She asks lots of questions to understand how my life is going as it relates to my health and gives me encouragement to improve it I would recommend her to anyone ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I originally started seeing Dr Keyes because of problems with hypertension and other severe physical symptoms She ran tests which revealed nothing and let it be It later came out after a visit to the emergency room and another doctor's visit that I have an anxiety disorder The only helpful thing she did was refer me to a psychiatrist When she ordered blood work and said I had to be fasting I asked if I could just do it in the morning so I could fast overnight and she replied irritably well that's what I just said  Later when I expressed concern about another symptom she practically insinuated that I was a hypochondriac and annoyingly told me you know I can't say that you are completely healthy but you really don't have to come and see me for every little thing maybe once a year  then when I went to see her two years later to try to give her a second chance  after having been to another clinic in the meantime  she yelled at me  it has been two years since you've come to see me why have you not been to see me  Enough I now realize that probably the reason why I was assigned to her in the first place is because she's had trouble keeping patients ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,I told her all my symptoms and she turned me away said I was healthy Now I have a cardiologist endocrinologist and neurologist after being admitted to the hospital for the same symptoms ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Nanyee_Keyes html, Nanyee L Keyes ,Told her I had numbness tingling and heat sensations She suggested I see a psychiatrist I've had MRI's since then and have small fiber neuropathy Needed a neurologist ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Natasha_Hakim html, Natasha Bica ,Love Dr Bica Awesome doctor,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Natasha_Hakim html, Natasha Bica ,She never addresses your symptoms she assume what she thinks you symptoms relate to without doing conclusive tests to confirm or deny When asked questions her answers are well I don't no hun  go home and google it She then taps onher watch letting me know I have 5 minutes remaining She has no regards for the nurse practioner whom I've seen numerous times took time correct me by say she is not a doctor but a nurse practioner and I don't agree with her prognosis ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Patricia_Tweedie html, Patricia A Tweedie ,I was a happy patient of Dr Tweedie for years I really liked her during all of my healthy years when she didn't treat me for much besides normal colds flu etc Within the last year I struggled with depression and anxiety both of which she was treating me for Anyone who struggles with depression knows it is almost impossible at times to even get out of bed That being said I cancelled and/or rescheduled a couple appointments mostly due to the fact that I could barely function Well her receptionist started to give me the most horrible attitude over the phone I could sense her judgment and annoyance toward me which really made me feel even more horrible Apparently I cancelled and missed too many appointments and I received a letter in the mail saying Dr Tweedie discharged me as a patient Now I understand time is money but I feel if you are treating a patient for an illness that you know can be quite debilitating maybe as a doctor you should call the patient personally to see what is going on before you send them discharge papers Needless to say I'm rather disappointed with the care she provided The ironic thing about all of this is my grandfather was the President and co founder of Primacare the company she works for ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Paul_Ketro html, Paul O Ketro ,This doctor has a horrible bedside manner and is unprofessional Rather than listening and assessing my problem he seemed more intent on berating me for canceling my previous year physicals His recommendation was to schedule an appointment with my PCP  she was not available at the time  to review my symptoms Umm shouldn't that have been his job during our appointment ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Paul_Ketro html, Paul O Ketro , Dr K as my kids call him is great He is realistic professional and tells us the exact truth and provides practical advice refusing to medicate problems away He listens very well and gives advice only when there is evidence to support its efficacy he moved to MGH's spot in the North End recently and we followed him ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,Excellent doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,Rude and dismissive,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,Dr Bianco was my primary care doctor and was always right on in a diagnosis for me He sent me to the very best doctors for any follow up ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,He is a great physician He cares for his patients and he is always current on recent trends and treatment alternatives ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,A wonderful kind and thoughtful physician The best staff that you could hope for I see them once a year and they still know my name when I walk in Especially Nancy ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,My husband & I have been patients of Dr Bianco for almost 20 years He was never warm & fuzzy but he has changed considerably during the past 10 He is usually very rushed and doesn't seem to care about more than getting his work done and getting you out of his office He is also pretty nasty to his staff but this morning he was totally out of control He was so verbally abusive to his staff He was yelling at his nurse swearing at her using the f word told her to shut her mouth and with no restraint the entire office could hear him I was in an examining room with the door closed and could hear him I came out of the exam room told him off and walked out I have filed a complaint with my health insurance and am contacting the medical board I was in to see him a couple of months ago and he sent me for x rays then left on vacation for 3 weeks without even telling me he was leaving and there was no one who could give me the x ray results until he returned Even then he never called me I called him after not hearing from him and then he tells me to get a copy of the x ray and go see my rheumatologist It turns out that I have tendonitis in my rotator cuff I gave him the benefit of the doubt on this experience but something is very wrong here We have felt like we needed to change doctors for quite some time and after this morning's experience with Dr Bianco we will definitely not be going back There is no excuse for this type of behavior by anyone much less a health care professional By the way if anyone finds his staff is not courteous or friendly it's because they can't be due to the pressure he puts on them and their working conditions I have no idea how any of them are able to work for this man ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,I have been a patient for over 10 years A few things that stand out to me although he's rushed and the staff isn't always quiet and professional The office is comfortable down to earth and feels like a family The doctor has phone hours he will talk to his patients on the phone and review lab results all things that he could easily make you go back into the office and bill you for Dr Bianco does not do this He has a conservative approach and treats the person as a whole not as a symptom I've even run into him outside of the office and he knew who I was asked me how I was doing any issues it proved to me that I was more than a chart in his files ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,I have only been a patient of Dr Bianco for about six months So far he has been very good When I need an appointment sometimes same day   it has been easy to schedule one His diagnoses have been right on and his and his staff's followup care and communication has been excellent ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Bianco html, Richard M Bianco ,This Dr cares nothing of his patients he rushes in and rushes out I guess we are nothing but dollar signs to Dr Bianco,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Rima_Downs html, Rima E Downs ,I had her for doctor for years She is great with my family ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Rima_Downs html, Rima E Downs ,Dr Downs has been my physician for 13 years I am now looking for a new physician as I feel like she is very quick to generalize She also has not been supportive in my desire to exclusively breastfeed my baby knowing this is very important to my family I was unnecessarily advised to stop and now my child and I are both having difficulty She never even took the time to be certain that it was imperative for me to stop when after very little research on my own I now know it was not ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Rima_Downs html, Rima E Downs ,Dr Downs is the best family doctor I have had I trust her implicitly with the care of my twins Dr Downs has seen my children for the past nine years and diagnosed a potential serious health risk in my daughter It turns out that everything is okay but Dr Downs was very thorough in the logistics we had to navigate through in order to ensure that the risk to my daughter was not significant I only hope that Dr Downs does not move on until my children become adults She is warm nurturing knowlegable and caring and I highly recommend her as a physician ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Robert_Babineau html, Robert A Babineau Jr ,Dr Babineau has been our PCP for many years now and he's the best He is not only professional and efficient but is a truly caring Dr He has taken the time to squeeze me in on a really busy day for him When I'm not feeling well he will take as much time as needed to figure out what is causing it Bottom line is he is the best ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Robert_D_Yager html, Robert D Yager ,I would not give this doctor any stars I suffered a head injury in 2005 and when I went to him for help after the ER visit Dr Yager accused me of wanting medication Basically accusing me of being a junkie who got into a domestic violence situation I stopped seeing him and found a real doctor who figured out I had nerve damage as a result of the fall and subsequent concussion If he had properly diagnosed me or recommended me to a neurologist the issue would have been caught early enough to fix in a short time Instead it nearly 10 years to undo the damage that was allowed to go on by Dr Yager ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Robert_J_Gagnon html, Robert J Gagnon ,Dr Gagnon seems to listen & care but makes quick judgment calls and sticks to them He seems to follow along with whatever the pharmaceutical companies are pushing and opts for the prescription fix verses actual diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause Nice guy fantastic office staff but not recommended BTW  my adult daughter had lyme disease he dx'd it as anxiety/depression Prescribed unneeded drugs and refused to look into her other issues stating that she might need counseling 3 years later she's been treated by a proper physician who recognized the symptoms and is fine : ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Roman_Tusinski html, Roman K Tusinski ,My review here is actually not for an appointment but for lack there of I recently had to go to the ER for an exsisting condition and I needed a follow up with my primary care Dr I called for that appointment and actually was having problems but he didn't have anything for a week and I needed to see someone ASAP I was sent to another Dr I then started having side effects from meds and needed some guidance from him I gave the info to the receptionist and she said I would get a call back which I did She took the same info I gave the receptionist and said she would speak to the Dr and get back to me This was early afternoon and I waited  in pain  until the office was actually closed and no one called me back I suffered all night and no one called even the following day I am very disappointed with this whole thing This rating is based on an appointment I never had but the above chart is for an actual appointment so I had to rate according to my last visit I have more I could say but I will not get into that ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Rupal_Thakor html, Rupal H Thakor ,First visit with Dr Rupal Thakor It is sad to say that the doctor needed to write information down so I could understand what she was saying English is her second language Communication is a necessary component when visiting a primary care physician In addition she ordered tons of unnecessary diagnostic laboratory work that is not typically covered by insurance companies and I have high tiered insurance plan I keep receiving bills from the office Called the office and Phea told me that it is my responsibility to check with my insurance company to make sure that all laboratory work  22 blood tests  that the doctor ordered are covered If you visit bring a pad/pencil so Dr Thakor can communicate with you and make sure you have your checkbook for any unnecessary lab fees It is unfortunate that as a patient in this office you need to advocate for yourself to understand your doctor and to question the doctor's unnecessary lab requests Wish I could give less than one star but unfortunately it is not an option ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Rupal_Thakor html, Rupal H Thakor ,I was referred to Dr Thakor's practice by a doctor I have been going to for 23 years I had to wait several months to be seen but that's ok I have been told that my medical problems are complex It was essential that I find a PCP I could be comfortable with both in terms of their personality and knowledge In my last two years of dealing with heart disease I have met a few physicians who are callous uncaring and not thorough I am a veterinarian so I understand disease processes medications etc I only want to be treated with the kindness and professionalism that I have always aspired to provide people and pets Dr Thakor communicates very well is thorough organized and patient I have left other doctor visits feeling confused and like I was rushed by the doctor On this first visit with Dr Thakor I felt that we had a plan and purpose Dr Thakor is very confident and considerate She wasn't dismayed by my questions thank goodness I strongly recommend her ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sazia_Nowrin html, Sazia Nowrin ,Both times my daughter had skin issues she never got back to me with what the underlying issue was either time The first skin issue was some sort of hives We actually saw Dr Downs for this because Dr Nowrin was out She told us that it could've been the sunscreen we were using but we used it again later in the summer and she was fine Eventually they went away and she was fine but there was no follow up testing that she wanted us to do The second skin issue were blister like holes all over her body We visited Dr Nowrin at urgent care because it looked like the one on her wrist was infected and all she did was give a band aid and vaseline She also said that we didn't need to wash out the cut I asked her what is was or what it was caused from but all she said was that it popped blister causing it to leak I pointed out the other spots on my daughters body and she wasn't concerend It's not like they were cuts they were being caused by something We saw her for a total of 5 minutes but waited hours to see her It was at the end of the day so she was probably exhausted and would explain why we were rushed out We had to go back a week later because it got VERY worse Multiple spots all over her body We scheduled a office visit with her so she could finally do her job and figure out what was going on This time she took pictures to send off to her dermatologist and gave me a prescription for an intense steroid and sent us on our way She said she will be in contact within a week about what the dermatologist said and WE HEARD NOTHING Two months later I get a bill for a co pay threatening me that its going to collections First of all I never got the first one Second of all you should've collected it at time of service I was under the impression that it was waived because this second visit could've totally been prevented if she did her job the first time Now besides the doctor not caring about her patients the office is horribly slow Nice but slow When I called to ask about the issue she said she would call me back the next day Nope I called back two days later and she said that she would call me back by 4:30 So I altered my entire schedule so I could be available for this phone call No call I called at 4:35 and they said that she was talking to the doctor and will call me back soon I once again waited for the phone call that did not come through until 6:00 All she said to me was that Dr Nowrin said  Usually patients that see her through urgent care have lingering issues  Well they wouldn't if she actually CARED or took the time the first time around I get it It's just a co payment whatever but I wouldn't have had to pay it twice if she took the time when we saw her originally to care for my daughter The steroid cream got rid of whatever it was I have no clue and apparently neither does this Doctor Throughout the time of having my daughter go to Dr Nowrin we've always had billing issues St Joes is notorious for sending people bills when they've already paid it Overall I just feel scammed and uncared for ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Stephen_Elgert html, Stephen D Elgert ,This man did not listen to my cause cares or concerns or treat me with respect After a visit he wrote me a prescription that wasn't covered by my insurance I was in chronic pain and bed ridden I spent 1 WEEK trying to get a hold of someone over there to get him to re write something that was covered by my insurance it was inhumane unacceptable and rude both him and the nursing staff at this practice are not at all thorough they say they will do something and don't follow through Honestly this man is so cold if you told him you were going to hang yourself cause your in so much chronic pain he would give you a noose Oh and to boot when he found out I was involved in a MVA and had a lawyer he started BILLING ME full price instead of my reduced rate insurance company which is against the law Shady awful people that don't belong in the health care industry I wouldn't go see this man if I had a nose bleed ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Steven_Roth html, Steven R Roth ,I had a similar experience as the previous reviewer I went to Dr Roth after having cancer surgery needing a PC from the area to co ordinate with all the other doctors I am dealing with who happen to be from South County I gave DR Roth a list of my medications   I am a sixty six yr old senior citizen  and asked if he had any problems with prescribing any of my meds He said no as long as I have documented reasons for taking them My next visit I brought my medical history all five hundred and sixty five pages worth showing him the history of my illnesses COPD Spinal Stenosis Sciatica Fibromyalgia Restless Leg Syndrome Bi Polar depression adult ADHD I had a treatment history going back ten years I saw this idiot five times and all five visits he talked about my medications neglecting my problems I was having from my Cancer operation He eliminated one of my Bi Polar medications saying because I was an Engineer I didn't have adult ADHD even though I was taking this medication for thirteen years and he stopped my pain medications saying I moved too good to have Fibromyalgia neglecting my other problems that caused severe pain So now I have been without my pain Meds for a month waiting for an appointment at a pain clinic which is still a month away This man has ruined my life I can't walk I can't sleep I am going insane with the pain Dr Roth has no compassion he is a very insecure man with a dangerous ego I wonder why Thundermist has him on their staff STAY AWAY FROM HIM ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Steven_Roth html, Steven R Roth ,As far as the doctors code of ethics Dr Roth is sorely lacking any He knowingly caused me physical harm and I was not treated with respect or dignity Dr Roth abruptly stopped my 11yr healthly working medication management plan fully aware that it would cause: increased intense pain hypertension dangerous complications and unheard of mental torment Dr Roth was arrogant rude and dimmissive to my concerned 77yr old mother Dr Roth's lack of treatment sent me to stunned ER specialists All agreed that Dr Roth's non treatment should not have been done to a person with my disabilities In general I find him to be an uncaring intimadating bully Dr Roth lacks basic human compassion and is too arrogant/immature to admit his mistakes I can not reccommend him to families or senior citizens ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Steven_Roth html, Steven R Roth ,Absolutely fantastic and professional Dr ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sung_Eun_Jang html, Sung Eun E Jang ,I've never had a physical where I wasn't required to get undressed and the doctor sat at the computer ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sung_Eun_Jang html, Sung Eun E Jang ,Dr hang always made me feel like she cared Like I was a person not a dollar sign She even called me one time after office hours to make sure I was ok,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,My husband and I are patients for 25+ years More than satisfied with her no nonsense approach and ability to quickly diagnose problems Her staff is helpful knowledgeable and always ready to help ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,I wish I could say I had positive feedback but I do not The fact she makes you come back every 3 months for a follow up if you are taking any meds is just ridiculous My mother goes to her and she just hands out pills left and right to her when clearly she has an addiction problem She is just a money hungry doctor that doesn't actually care about her patients I have recently switched and am waiting for the call saying I am being charged to get my records sent over ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,Do NOT go to this doctor not a patient advocate ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,Dr Godiwala is the best I was having cronic pain for years other doctors just kept telling me I had depression and giving me medication that didn't work Dr Godiwala saw that it wasn't depression and that I had fibromyalga Now I'm pain free ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,Most ridiculous doctor I have dealt with Is it easy to get an appointment far in the future Yes That doesn't matter Do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this woman Her staff is mediocre  was waiting for an appt and overheard a few of them making fun of clients after getting off the phone with them  really unprofessional   just like her interest in actually caring about your health She is in it for the money Wait time is usually 15 20 mins for a 5 10 minute appointment She brushed off things I was concerned about in a rude manner when I brought them up No explanations I had to go visit an urgent care because she was unavailable and when I had my next appointment with her she said they didn't receive the paperwork  Urgent Care told me that Godiwala would not accept the paperwork/results faxed  WHAT   and made me go get it myself while I was still sick If you want to get your records she'll charge you $75+ For anyone dealing with this use the client website portal to print your records off In my opinion they don't care about you unless you're giving them money Find a doctor who actually cares instead of this woman ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,My appointment was for a physical and Dr said I would need to make a follow up appointment before she would refill a prescription She also ordered labwork and said because I didn't have to pay a co paymentfor a physical a new health insurance regulation states I would need to make a follow up appointment to discuss the results I called my health insurance company and confirmed there is no such regulation Clearly Dr Godiwala's goal is $$$ as stated in others' reviews I have switched Dr 's as I cannot put my health in the hands of someone who blatantly lies ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,I would not let dr Godiwala treat my dog She is a rude unprofessional money hungry dr She has no bedside manner She won't look at me during our one sided discussions of my health I am extremely healthy so why did I need to go back every 2 months If I cancelled an appointment I couldn't get my prescriptions until I made a new appointment I transferred to a new doctor who I am very pleased with If you value your health go to a new physician Convenience is not the way to go when you are concerned about your health because if you do go to her the only person who cares about your health is you I just wanted a Doctor who I felt at ease with and if I had a concern they would look into it I didn't want to be a money sign ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,I saw Dr Godiwala years ago and I have long since changed doctors but I wanted to write now in case someone is considering this doc First of all Godiwala does not have a good bedside manner During a Pap smear I thought she was done and started to move She yelled at me that she wasn't done Then it hurt during the Pap smear When she was done she threw a box of tissues at me and said  Here Clean up  I felt so uncomfortable Her manner was so rude Then come to find out there was blood in the sample and she complained that she had to do the Pap smear again  but that was because she was rough with me  The tone in her voice was like she blamed me I also had ongoing depression concerns I told her I had been feeling better for a while but then had started to feel depressed again Godiwala told me that I was bipolar and gave me strong antipsychotic meds I thought that was strange diagnosing me from one sentence I have never been told by any other doc that I am bipolar On another note my sister said that Godiwala inappropriately touched her She says that the doc took a long time with her Pap smear and seemed to enjoy doing it Most of the time I visited Godiwala all she would do is talk about my acne I had other more important concerns but her main focus seemed to be the pimples on my face I wasn't that concerned with them but she was Every time I left her office I had 2 3 new prescriptions That's crazy I don't like pill pushing docs Also my older sister and mother didn't like her either We ALL swtiched docs and are much happier now What does that tell you The office staff isn't great either They've been rude to me most times Like the other reviewer I also had a hard time getting my medical records They charged me but never sent my records I had to call multiple times Please if you can find another doctor any doctor but hopefully a good one Please don't see Godiwala Your health is important and everyone deserves a caring good doc ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Sunita_Godiwala html, Sunita N Godiwala ,I would not recommend this Dr to my worst enemy Dr Godiwala does not understand what it means to supply service and to have compasion or understanding to patients She has even gone as far as to slander myself  a former pt   and write untrue things about me She is un ethical and unprofessional I needed my medical records forwarded to my new Dr  in another state When I called to get them her office staff quoted me a $75 00 plus fee to obtain these I had a total of 5 pages from past visits I know this because before I moved I had to have records for another reason there in MA Having once worked for years in the medical field and more important as a medical records specialist I am aware of patients rights and what is/is not ethical  and legal might I add  to charge a pt Never more then a $15 00 fee should ever be charged to a pt and NEVER should a fee be charged to another physician requesting these After reporting her office to the medical board in MA due to no progress with the office and even after indicating to them that I looked up the HIPPA compliance laws for the state of MA and what is and is not legal to charge a pt for records I was informed that they would drop the complaint and also sent me a letter Dr Godiwala wrote to them in regards to me Mind you the Dr never once spoke to me directly but yet has the nerve to state that I went off on her office manager using ubscene language and hanging up on her on 3 different occasions I only actually spoke to her office manager one time and the receptionist the other time Both times I was talking to them from my current employers office in which I had someone in close proximaty of me both times I have witnesses that will testify to my character that I do not use ubscene language in the first place and that I am a pretty mild tempured person I do not appreciate this doctors slanderous words against me My only objective in reporting her was to help other patients of hers side step this situation I am not the only one she has tried to over charge for records My fiance' EX wife was told she would have to pay in excess of $200 00 for her daughters records to take to another Dr Dr Godiwala needs to learn that even though these records exsist in her office they are the legal property of each individual pt In the 5 yrs I worked for medical records the only time we even charged anyone for records is if it was a Law office workmans comp claim or if the pt had over 75 pages in thier charts Know your rights as a patient and do not let doctors like Dr Godiwala take unfair advantage of you ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_Porter html, Susan D Porter ,Dr Porter always makes you feel like you're her only patient I have been with her since the late 90's and could not ever imagine not being able to see her I was one of those people who didn't like going to see the doctor but every year since the first time seeing her my yearly physicals are done without nervousness because of her wonderful bedside manner I even said at one time if my insurance didn't cover my visits with Dr Porter I would pay out of pocket ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_Porter html, Susan D Porter ,She is very friendly and listens Dr Porter is a very kind doctor However she is still learning along the way She will be an even better doctor in the future ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,Dr Young is the best Dr I've ever had she is the only one I delt with in the office,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,My experience with Dr Young has been less than expected from a professional I've been a patient for five years and I must say I've healthy and have not had to schedule sickness appts except for one I had been sick for several days and was finding it very difficult to drag myself out of bed but did and I went to work I called the office and they said if I could be there before noon I could see the Dr I left work Stow MA and proceeded to Leominster at 1155 I was in Sterling and called and explained I was 10 15 mins out and they told me don't bother its their lunch and they can't see me I turned around and went home However over the past previous 4 years never once was I taken on time I questioned the Dr why she never asked me to show for a blood screening prior to my appts Oh your blood results are ok I wondered how she knew that since they were only drawn twice in 5 yrs The second draw was after my appt last yr when she asked why I was taking so much D3 I had my blood drawn after that at her request and was called later to be informed to continue with the dosage As a minimum I waited 30 mins before being brought in to an office and then I would sit for an addition 15 + mins until seen I accepted this however the final straw was this past week when I showed for a appt 10 mins prior to schedule After thirty five mins I went to the desk and asked why everyone in the office and people coming in after me had been seen and I hadn't been called Ten mins later I was taken to an office where I sat for another 10 mins and the Dr came in an hour after my scheduled appt She explained I wasn't checked in I explained I've had it with the schedule not once in 5 yrs had I been taken on time and that I would not be returning For someone that only visits the Dr once a year for a physical I also think that in a year blood results could change drastically especially if your over the age of 60 ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,I had a bad experience several years ago and it could have cost me my life I had pain every other month on my right side Turns out when I ovulated on my right side I had cancer in my ovary Dr Susan Young told me to take Advil I was in so much pain after a office visit I asked her if I could have Advil to help me with my pain to walk to my car She said yes but never returned to give it to me I remember driving to a CVs for pain medicine Her investment in my pain was poor Once on the phone I cried while talking to her because My pain was severe there was a pause then she advised me to take Advil Stay away from her she is not an invested or very smart doctor She presents as immature I am alive due to my own persistence change in doctor and my life now only hold resentment to Dr Susan Young I have three children and a dependent sister I care for I'm alive today because I left her care fast ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,Misdiagnosed Spent a month in the hospital ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,Dr Young is very black and white when it comes to medicine She speeds through appointments and is a bad listener I wouldn't recommend her to anybody that wants to prevent disease ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,Worst Dr I've ever had She and her office let me suffer for days before they'd help me Once I got them to see me and my condition she said she felt bad and would help  I had already gone to urgent care in Fitchburg and got great care I only went to the appointment so she could see how bad I was still after 4 days of treatment from another Dr Every time I call which is not often this practice is never willing to help Most recently I called for belviq a appetite suppressant  prescribed by only a doctor  and I was told they won't perscribe those Well if you can only get them by a doctor why won't they Just plain lazy practice ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,Probably one of the rudest Drs i have ever met and i work in a hospital Had to see her as she was the only one with an appointment available on my day off ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Susan_M_Young html, Susan M Young ,I've been a patient of Dr S Young for years now she takes time to make sure you have what you need medicine referrals and always asks more questions than I would expect She's rushed but never seems to cut me off she allows me to ask questions & she answers them as she can or gives me the directions to where I can find the answers The office is flexible in scheduling which is GREAT and I've never had a billing issue or an issue getting any refills for any of my prescriptions Aside from the wait  which I don't mind because the waiting room is inviting peaceful classical music playing every magazine to read that you can think of comfortable even for kids if you have them  That's about the only issue if I call the office & need something the receptionist takes the message & w/ in minutes no more than an hour I always receive a call back w/ a smile on the other end ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Syed_S_Ali_2 html, Syed S Ali ,I found Dr Ali to question everything i said was asked questions he only wanted a yes or no answer not allowed to explain Because i refused a med he told me i had heart problems prior visit he said my heart was good very manipualative Questione what i had in a cup i said water he asked where i got it he thinks i was a drinker I am not Excessive appointments every 30 days i had to tell him i was going away to get a break from him asked jhow long was i going for ivw had enough blood draws one visit i said i had a headache i was given orders for an MRI of my head cat scans up the ying ying I have been going through testing with my Gastrointerologist but this guy qants more testing Do not go to him ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Syed_S_Ali_2 html, Syed S Ali ,Cares about his work thorough easily accessible but lacks bedside manner over controlling and wants to control every aspect versus meeting patient in the middle where they are at imposes his own value system on his patients,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Syed_S_Ali_2 html, Syed S Ali ,Dr Ali successfully treated my chronic condition after having visited multiple physicians with little success He is highly intelligent thorough analytical and dedicated He answers questions and concerns with knowledge and compassion ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Syed_S_Ali_2 html, Syed S Ali ,Awful experience Awful bedside manners and I do not recommend ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Syed_S_Ali_2 html, Syed S Ali ,Dr Ali is best doctor I ever met in USA I changed so many states and doctor He tells the consequences of taking any medicine and how to prevent further upcoming disease Preventive care is really good ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,Dr Futrell is thorough knowledgeable and dedicated to patient success I am most satisfied with her expertise and diligence as she helped me return to activities many doctors over many years couldn't accomplish She's fantastic ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,Dr Futrell is a knowledgable professional She asks all the questions that are relevant to the issues you come to talk about and has treated each one appropriately and efficiently Be sure to let the secretary know ALL of the issues you want addressed so you get the right length of time to see her  the practice is very full and fast moving and works hard to stick to their schedule ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,This doctor is one in a thousand She actually knew what I was talking about and treated my complex bladder infection properly Over many many years she is a first She keeps up with the literature obviously and I did not have to beg her for appropriate treatments or educate her about chronic cystitis She was very thorough and proactive in following up in many ways I'm surprised and delighted to find a doctor this good I have had so many frustrating experiences with this problem I can hardly believe my good luck this time Yes she seems a bit cool at first but I will take competency first and warm fuzzy later She does warm uo ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,Dr Futrell is caring and conscientious 15 minutes is never a lot of time but she takes the time to answer my question and always follows up if more time or another appointment is needed I would recommend Dr Futrell to anyone ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,Don't bother to tell her what your issues are She will tell you Very curt manner belittling and condescending And heaven forbid don't be a smoker or overweight or into alternative therapies I cried in my car in the parking lot when I left ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,She has a very poor interaction with patients trying to rush through the appointments She is very cold and burnt out already I will never go to her again I am a healthcare professional ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,While pregnant I met with Dr Futrell and went over my very specific desires for the care of my infant I was rather far along in my pregnancy due to a change in doctors where I was planning to take my child She was receptive to all of my desires and I left there feeling rather comfortable and relieved Everything changed in the hospital where she was a day late to come and release my son she claimed she did not agree with any of my care plan and scolded me for the way my son was born Needless to say I immediately said she was not permitted near my son again and I ended up having a random on call doctor release my son from the hospital and now am with a wonderful pediatrician My only advice is to beware she seems to be willing to say what she needs to get a patient and then change her tune completely Apparently people are just dollar signs to her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,Dr Futrell is great She is very proactive about my care listens well and offers me multiple approachs to improving my health rather than just writing a prescription She reviewed my family history as well  heart disease  and checks me for that stuff each time The staff is great too and I never have waited for than 5 10 minutes ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,Dr Futrell is insanely rude and hardly took the time to say hello to me As a person in a position of power it is vital that Dr Futrell treats her patients with kindness and compassion Dr Futrell ignored my symptoms on a number of occasions in an effort to 'speed' up the appointment As a result I have been left with an injury that I will have to deal with for the rest of my life On a number of occasions I have left her office in tears and have felt that she is simply 'burnt out' I would NEVER tell any person that I cared about to see her ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,I can only say that my experience with Dr Futrell was incredible I came to her in a panic and her calm bedside manner not only eased my mind but eased the anxiousness of my 6 year old as well It was as if a family member was tending to my child This was the first time my son did not want to leave and held on to the leg of Dr Futrell She is a true gift to the medical field and I would recommend her to anyone I will no go anywhere else ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tara_Futrell html, Tara D Futrell ,While giving a shot to a four year old the nurse didn't hold his leg and then blamed him for moving and causing a 3 inch welt from the needle It's amazing how some people remain employed ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tej_Bansal html, Tej V Bansal ,With a focus on my obesity she never diagnosed my Graves Disease which I complained about to her for 6 8 years Also saw he husband who missed diagnosing me and he is an endocrinologist At the end of our patient /dr relationship she refused to fill my blood pressure medicines after saying she would several times Finally my pharmacy told me she does this frequently and I should find a new doctor I did and after landing in the er in Boston I was diagnosed in 3 days ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tej_Bansal html, Tej V Bansal ,This Dr's office has the most difficult and unprofessional people running their front desk I think it shows a lot about a Dr based on the qualitly of help they keep Also a family member saw a doc here and he started off telling her she had a medical condidion that she didn't Ended up he was looking a someone elses chart Unacceptable for a doctor He also told me that my last blood test over a year ago  said that I had borderline diabetes yet noone ever called me for a follow up he just told me an entire year later Ended up being not true again after another blood test So If you want to find out you have a medical condition a year after the drs think you have one go to this md I highly recommend you find another dr before stepping foot into this one Good luck if you do ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Jaquith_Houston html, Thomas E Jaquith-Houston ,Dr Thomas Jaquith Houston Is an amazing doctor He has saved my life on more then one occasion If I never found him I would not be able to hold my head up And then Dr Houston made me go get an X ray of my belly because he thought I had a bowel obstruction He was right I had an obstruction If he never sent me for the X ray I probably would of died at home since you only have an 8 percent survival rate if you don't take care of it I have never met a doctor like him before I respect him and his opinions He has always been respectful caring and down to earth and he really listens to his patients It's a very rare quality to find in a doctor these days And he never rushes a visit I had a little problem with one of his staff members so out of haste I let Dr Houston go I really wish I never let him go I have been looking for another PCP for about 5 months now I can't find anyone as good as him And I honestly don't think I ever will I wish I never let him go Dr Houston is a fantastic doctor you will never find another doctor like him So if he is already your doctor never let him go And if you are thinking about making him your PCP Please do so You won't ever be sorry I really do wish I could go back in time I gave up a wonderful doctor Though all my medical records still go to him and I never changed doctors yet And he still has all my medical records By law he is still my doctor I just wish I could tell him how sorry I was I want my doctor back Dr Thomas Jaquith Houston is the best primary care around If you want a Dr that will respect you listen to you take the time out to get to know you never rush you no matter how many questions you have And a man who is down to earth Then Dr Houston is the doctor for you ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,I have not been to this office in YEARS But the fact that I switched doctors 6 years ago and they REFUSE to send my records to my new doctor is absolutely insane When I was a patient there I was told not to bring up health problems at my physical as it would be another appointment co pay The receptionist was rude and while being a patient there for 10 years I never saw the actual physician once ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,First I have never even seen the physician only his constantly changing and incompetent PA's Not only has the staff tried to push unneeded tests diagnostic exams and medications but they have also given false personal information to unauthorized family members Recently I called to have a prescription filled and was told I needed to make an appointment in order for a one month supply to be prescribed I went ahead and made an appointment and was told my prescription was sent to the pharmacy After many phone calls to both this office and the pharmacy I noticed I had been given the run around No prescription was ever sent to the pharmacy  thankfully it wasn't a life altering medication and could be done without for a few days  When I finally called to get everything straightened out amist the attitude I received I was told if I could come in sooner then I would have my prescription sent to the pharmacy I asked to speak to the provider and was put on hold for 10 minutes only to find out she was busy I received a call later that day stating the medication had been called into the pharmacy with no explaination or apology of the event Needless to say I will be finding a new provider ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,This office is the most scatter brained disfunctional disorganized and money hungry group of medical professionals I have ever been to I recently moved up to the area and sadly had to choose a different PCP All they seem to care about is money and how they are going to get paid They are certainly not in this field for patients care or well being The nurse assistants who bring you in to take your vitals are very patient oriented sweet and very courteous Although they seem to be overworked and underpaid They do the job of 5 people I have seen both nurse practitioners for sick appointments and would recommend them if they worked at a different office Front desk is courteous helpful and welcoming I only clicked on the 1 star because I was not allowed to leave blank If I could leave a negative star I would have all the way down the board Stay away Office manager is a joke she withholds my medication which is needed for a chronic condition unless I make a monthly appointment I have never in my 40 years have had a office manager speak down to me as she has over the phone I do not understand the point in having to see my regular doctor for a refill Makes me believe they want me to come in for my medication just to be able to bill my insurance for an office visit There are many other great doctors and practices in the area who actually care about their patients and not a check from your insurance please please please STAY AWAY ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,Just awful Will be removing my family of 4 today ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,not willing to listen to the person in need for help he always just goes on what he learned in school what he don't understand everybody is different and the doctors he sends you to for stuff he wont treat for those doctors don't take notes like they should in my case I went to a few and went back to the Dr for more help on my issue he went in my records to look for notes from the doctors he sent me to they never took notes down so pretty much I could not get further help with out going through all that again by seeing more doctors so I would never recommend anyone to go there and also his 2 star rating should speak for its self,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,Extremely rude never diagnosed me correctly Also extremely expensive given the poor service,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,For 10 years we have been going to Dr Cammilleri office and never saw him once The one time that my husband asked to be seen by him was when he was not feeling his normal self His body was covered with purple marks so he really wanted to see the doctor and not anybody else He scheduled an appointment with Dr Cammilleri and the doctor did absolutely nothing No exams no blood work and said he could go camping the next day because he didn't see any major problem In fact he said the purple marks could be from exercising After 12 days my husband was diagnosed with acute leukemia  early mortality rate of ~15   and passed away one week later If he had started treatment two weeks prior when he was still physically healthy he may of been able to be here today with his family and friends Please save yourself and your loved ones  don't go to this doctor Moreover the receptionists have no sympathy all they care is about making an appointment and seeing your insurance card Turn For 10 years we have been going to Dr Cammilleri office and never saw him once The one time that my husband asked to be seen by him was when he was not feeling his normal self His body was covered with purple marks so he really wanted to see the doctor and not anybody else He scheduled an appointment with Dr Cammilleri and the doctor did absolutely nothing No exams no blood work and said he could go camping the next day because he didn't see any major problem In fact he said the purple marks could be from exercising After 12 days my husband was diagnosed with acute leukemia  early mortality rate of ~15   and passed away one week later If he had started treatment two weeks prior when he was still physically healthy he may of been able to be here today with his family and friends Please save yourself and your loved ones  don't go to this doctor Moreover the receptionists have no sympathy all they care is about making an appointment and seeing your insurance card Turn around while you can while you can ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,they should take his medical license and tear it up along with his staff who can t even do billing correctly ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,My husband has Benn going here for quite a few years My husband has been sick with pancreatitis from a gallstone that dislodged and cut his pancreas Dr Camilleri should have been testing his pancreas levels and not once did he do that About 5 weeks ago he had become sick again and I called to have him go in a and be checked out first of all dr Camilleri said he should have gallbladder out and we told it was taken out already anyway they never tested his pancreas levels so we switched dictators to a core doctor They have been super and tested my husband for everything including pancreas levels The levels are high and also he has some spots on the pancreas and my husband needs to go to Beth Israel to see a specialist Thank God we pushed this and most of all changed doctors I would not ever recommend this office to anyone I hope things are not life threatening with my husband dr camilleri I do not know how you live with yourself Money is more important to you than patients well being Thank you ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,If you are new to the area please PLEASE look elsewhere unless you like wasting time and money on NOTHING SPECIAL TWO PART PHYSICALS Which of course means two co pays and two full insurance charges to your insurance company Anything to get your $$$$$ They will HOLD YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS HOSTAGE if you are late for your MAMMOGRAM This place is the perfect example of a Modern Age QUACK SHOP Any REAL family practitioner would NEVER spend their time injecting botox for his pill popping wife's so called spa  when there are patients to be seen not CLIENTS Quest Labs also pulled their phlebotomist from the practice because GHFM illegally billed the patient a co pay for them to have their labs drawn by another business that money belonged to THE PATIENT AND QUEST LABS And this went on for YEARS before it caught up to them Healthcare is a very small world when you work in it Their turnover of practitioners and office staff / medical assistants certainly a testament to how they are treated by the office manager who happens to be The doctor's WIFE Trust me I have worked in the medical field in this area for twenty years this is NOT the kind of people you should trust your healthcare wallet and children's healthcare to ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,I have been a patient for about 5 years and the wait is the waiting room is probably 10 minutes or so but when they put you in an examining room sometimes it's more than 20 minutes I have never been seen by the doctor  but they sure have a revolving door for nurse practitioners All the good ones have come and gone How can someone evaluate you when they don't take the time to get to know you My husband went there complaining that he was sore in his joints and back and was told simply : you're just getting old We have since moved on to abetter practice that we always get to see the doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,As a patient for over 10 years I once thought this was a good establishment local to me Unfortunately the last year has been a completely different story The staff is rude and unprofessional you can never get an appointment with the dr always his evolving door of physicians assistants who have misdiagnosed my health issues Even when it was obvious that the PA didnt have a clue he said he would go get the dr and have a look but the doctor told him to just run a bunch of tests and never came to check out my condition or listen to me about the research I had already done Instead those tests cost me $600 post insurance Since than It has been like pulling teeth to get referrals and recently the doctor refused to process referrals causing me to contact Blue Cross The member services at BCBS took a formal complaint from me and tocovered the referrals advising me sternly to Find a new doctor On top of all this the office is filled with advertisements for their spa and other related businesses The doctor is money driven and does not care about his patients ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,They actually billed me $25 00 for a no show visit when the appointment had previously been rescheduled Who does that They split your first visit with them into 2 co pays from your insurance So for a family of 4 it costs $200 00 to get physicals and we have insurance My first visit I waited 55 minutes in a patient room and when the PA came in she never even apologized I will not and do not recommend you visit this office ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,I have given this place more chances than I should have My neighbors and my husband have been telling me for years to get a new doctor and now I will This office is run by a money hungry person They only want your money and must spend countless hours devising new ways to get more money out of you Everything the other reviewers have cited are still true today They will hold your prescription refills hostage if you haven't been in to see them within 3 months They intentionally send you away telling you that you have a virus and telling you to come back in a few days if your no better This is purely so they can collect on a second office visit Why not rule out strep throat on the first visit Well because they won't double their money that way You will never get to see the same nurse practitioner more than once because the nurse practitioner turnover rate is RIDICULOUS And I mean that I have no idea what they do to these poor young NP's that makes them run for the hills but believe me they do If you see any positive reviews I am sure they are written by the doctor's wife Do not waste your time energy and money When you are sick you want to be taken care of Please do yourself a favor and find a real doctor ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,The turnover of the P A 's and N P is beyond reproach It speaks volumes for the way this practice is run Very young grads are hired who spend just enough time to get experience then move on to better opportunities and frankly I do not blame them The office is run more like a business for profit only and not about a medical practice that is concerned about the patient There are signs posted thru out the office stating if you are late or cancel you will be charged and you have to sign all kinds of paperwork stating your responsiblity I have no problem with this but the Doctor should show the same courtesy to the patient if he is running over 30 minutes late our time from work is just as valuable The practice will hold your presciptions if they feel you are overdue for any appt regardless of the importance I was called by office staff and sent letters stating I was overdue for test that I do not even see the Doctor for and interestly I was not overdue You cannot see the Doctor after 3:30p m as he works in his wifes spa in the afternoon This medical practice is clearly all about the bottom line and not the patient I do not put the blame on the staff as they are only doing what they are ordered to do How unfortunate that a practioner has come down to this level I would recommend this practice if you want to visit a spa for botox as they seem to spend alot of money on advertising for the doc's wife's practice attached to his office ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,This practice is just a business They find an excuse to put you on a path that requires recurring visits and then they make you come in every six weeks  while holding your prescriptions hostage in order to make sure you show up I got bounced around between 5 different PAs during the last year and never actually saw the doctor You have to explain your situation all over again each time you get switched to a new person It was clear to me that the goal of this practice was to produce regular billable visits as frequently as possible The practice is augmented with additional money making gimmicks: Specialty diets skin care laser treatments and other services They always have a continuous infomercial running in the waiting area where the captive audience has to hear about some other pseudo medical service we should want to buy It's a great business but it doesn't resemble a medical practice in any way that I'd want to be a part of ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,I really like this Doctor's Office They take the time to diagnose and explain everything to me I highly recommend them ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,I would like to say that this Doctor and his staff are the best They really take the time to get to know each patient and take care of them properly In this day and age of Hospital run Doctors offices they really don't care about you it is all about the money This is not the case at Dr Cammilleri's office ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,I would have to say that this is by far the best Doctors Office I have ever been to I am not sure why there are people who would say bad things on this website One has to wonder if they are past disgruntled workers And to the comment of the Healthy Kids insurance commentator that is a government insurance plan I was once on it but now I have a job and am not at the mercy of the wellfare system ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,Your practice is all about catering to the rich affluent people of the community If you have Healthy Kids for your children and they need an x ray even though you have the capabilities in house to take the x ray Healthy Kids does not pay what you want for that service so you send them off to yet another appointment somewhere else Further more not one of your staff is a Certified Radiology Technician you have taken advantage of lax NH state laws regarding certified Radiology Technicians Your providers should be ashamed to even work for this practice as well as all your rude employees especially your wife who is the absolute WORST office manager Money Money Money that is all Dr C and Connie and their incompetent son are all about ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,It is only about the money You can't ask questions about more than one thing You have to make an appointment for something else ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,This practice is all about earning money and not about treating patient's ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Thomas_Cammilleri html, Thomas J Cammilleri Jr ,If you want a practice that is all about the money then this is the doctor for you If you want a practice that is all about YOU the patient then keep looking ,2,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Timothy_Keenan html, Timothy G Keenan ,I was experiencing some back issues for several years but I was very leery of having back surgery I wanted to hear of someone who had a great experience rather than just a good experience from having a procedure done on their back All I heard about was the so so or bad experiences Then one of my friends told me about the fantastic surgery that Dr Timothy Keneen had done for him and suggested that I give him a try I was totally surprised when meeting with him and his staff My wife and I were completely put at ease from the first time we met The surgery went just as he had explained to us with amazing results But more amazing was the quick recovery The doctor's procedure was totally non invasive which allowed me to recovery so quick that my people weren't sure I'd actually had surgery I tell my friends that my 4 week recovery took 4 days I am back to doing everything I did before the surgery  except hanging sheetrock  and I would recommend Dr Keenen to anyone considering back surgery In fact I already have ,5,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Timothy_Keenan html, Timothy G Keenan ,I was so frightened of surgery because I had heard some horror stories I was in so much pain I was not improving so I went to Dr Keenan The surgery was so smooth and so was my recovery My fears were senseless and it's been a year and I have no problems at all Dr Keenan was understanding and put my mind at ease Would highly recommend him ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tracy_Fritz html, Tracy A Fritz ,I refuse to recommend Tracy Fritz She caused more financial burden emotional and stress then any parent should go through She told me that my son had PANDAS and that she was the only doctor that could treat him now I will admit the first appointment she connected dots and made it sound very real and we scheduled an appointment 1 month out during that month I dove into reading about pandas and everything I could I was stressing and worrying about my son due to her saying that it caused swelling on the brain and more She would charge $25 per fax $5 per page beyond her 2 minimal page requirement and $50 for every 15 minute she would spend writing a email to anybody needing to know about her diganosis by second visit I had compiled a series of questions and when she was giving me off the wall answers I knew something was wrong I decided to go to 5 different doctors to have my son looked at The moment I mentioned her name they would roll their eyes and tell me she does more harm than good and that she should not have her med license I never went back she never tried to contact me and then a short time later her office closed she is a fraud and takes advantage of people and takes their money SHAME ON TRACY FRITZ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tracy_Fritz html, Tracy A Fritz ,I will never go back to Dr Fritz She was completely rude and extremely cold and unfeeling during my appointment She was rushed and did not take time to listen to my concerns or answer my questions In this day and age there are plenty of doctors to choose from Do not choose this one ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tricia_Vorderstrasse html, Tricia L Vorderstrasse ,Should have read the writing on the wall when as a new patient they lost my paperwork even before my first visit Then over the months numerous other issues Other family members or I would arrive for scheduled appointments only to discover the appointment was never entered into the computer and then rudely treated as if we made the error Prescriptions are constantly wrong each time causing issues at the pharmacy Phone calls are never returned and results are never relayed Health issues don't seem to really taken seriously made to feel like a hypochondriac If it wasn't for the two nurse practitioners I would have left much sooner They were at least courteous and look patients in the eye ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tricia_Vorderstrasse html, Tricia L Vorderstrasse ,I find it extremely difficult to find a good doctor and the medical staff here i found to be superb However the front desk is somewhat inept I had called to update my information and double check my appointment as i had moved away  fairly far mind you  I wanted to keep the same doctor as my experience with the medical staff was excellent Once i arrived for my appointment they informed me they had canceled my appointment Claiming they called me and left a detailed message at my house  with a number i had never seen before  they exclaimed Apparently no one gave you the detailed message besides she doesn't even come in on Monday's until 3pm  My thought was number one  do they check if they have the correct number because i know they had alternatives for me if one got mixed up and two  why did you schedule it that way then but i digress I had managed to get a day off and driven over two hours to the office for the appointment  a testament to the medical staff themselves  only to be turned away All of this while i was suppose to be getting blood work done for what may be a fairly serious condition Unfortunately it seems ill need to try to find another doctor as i cant afford to waste days on incompetence ,3,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tricia_Vorderstrasse html, Tricia L Vorderstrasse ,Should have read the writing on the wall when as a new patient they lost my paperwork even before my first visit Then over the months numerous other issues Other family members or I would arrive for scheduled appointments only to discover the appointment was never entered into the computer and then rudely treated as if we made the error Prescriptions are constantly wrong each time causing issues at the pharmacy Phone calls are never returned and results are never relayed Health issues don't seem to really taken seriously made to feel like a hypochondriac If it wasn't for the two nurse practitioners I would have left much sooner They were at least courteous and look patients in the eye ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Tricia_Vorderstrasse html, Tricia L Vorderstrasse ,I find it extremely difficult to find a good doctor and the medical staff here i found to be superb However the front desk is somewhat inept I had called to update my information and double check my appointment as i had moved away  fairly far mind you  I wanted to keep the same doctor as my experience with the medical staff was excellent Once i arrived for my appointment they informed me they had canceled my appointment Claiming they called me and left a detailed message at my house  with a number i had never seen before  they exclaimed Apparently no one gave you the detailed message besides she doesn't even come in on Monday's until 3pm  My thought was number one  do they check if they have the correct number because i know they had alternatives for me if one got mixed up and two  why did you schedule it that way then but i digress I had managed to get a day off and driven over two hours to the office for the appointment  a testament to the medical staff themselves  only to be turned away All of this while i was suppose to be getting blood work done for what may be a fairly serious condition Unfortunately it seems ill need to try to find another doctor as i cant afford to waste days on incompetence ,3,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Valerie_Danielson html, Valerie J Danielson ,Do not go to this doctor if you need a diagnosis She may be able to treat simple common things and be pleasant but beyond that she does not know much ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Valerie_Danielson html, Valerie J Danielson ,My husband and I love Dr Danielson she reminds me of the doctors I had when I was young and they spent time listening to you and making you feel good ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Valerie_Danielson html, Valerie J Danielson ,She is an excellent doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Valerie_Danielson html, Valerie J Danielson ,I find the entire staff from reception to the nurse to the physican to all be exceptional in their dealing with the patient,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Valerie_Moreland html, Valerie J Moreland ,Have had Dr Moreland for about 8 years now as my PCP Always have a good experience She is very thorough and empathetic to my needs Highly recommend her to anyone ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Valerie_Moreland html, Valerie J Moreland ,Dr Moreland serves as both my primary care and my children's pediatrician I did not have medical visits very often before having children As children often have urgent care needs I do find it's very difficult to have an emergency visit and have gone to the ER at least once b/c I could not get an appointment less than 24 hours in the future Even for physicals she books out 3 6 months in advance Her practice is growing which will allow more flexibility  hopefully  in the future Her bedside manner is great She cares about even the smallest thing She's been an advocate to insurance agencies on our behalf She will not take on a medical issue that she is not 100 comfortable managing and she is not too proud to ask a specialist or colleague for a consult This is very important to me as a mother  a doctor's pride is not more important than my child's health I recommended Dr Moreland for anyone looking for an uncomplicated PCP ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Veronica_Rusu html, Veronica D Rusu ,Dr Rusu has been my primary care doctor for more than 15 years Always provided clear pertinent and thorough care She is highly compassionate experienced and respected in the community Always available to listen to my problems and very approachable Several times throughout the years she identified overlooked conditions and took prompt action The best doctor I've ever had ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Veronica_Rusu html, Veronica D Rusu ,I loved having this doctor as a primary until lately she lately disregards my concerns and says it's ok which is on sometimes but today was the final straw Her on call prescribed me a medication that had traces of something I am allergic to and as an alternate she recommended something that is one of my top allergies I feel like she doesn't even look at my chart or even try anymore I am always sick and in the hospital now and I feel like if I continue to be her patient I could be jeopardizing my health ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,She had no investment in my problems She only seemed to want to prescribe me stuff and get me out of her office never seemed to care about my problems at all She rarely addressed my concerns and questions,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,All my concerns & questions were answered in a most timely manner I felt as thou I was a VIP with all the test & procedures I feel confident in her care & highly recommend her & her staff ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,I'm a new patient of Dr Parekh and I'm so happy to have her as my Dr she went over everything you could possibly go over and she had a great understanding of all my health issues She has a wonderful bedside manner and I think she is the best Dr around Would recommend to everyone ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,I called the office to complain of pain from an ongoing issue I have never called with an issue so assumed someone would call me back within 24 hrs I was told a nurse will call It is 7 days later and I called to be told with HUGE attitude that I need to come in  next available 3 weeks  or go to urgent care Rudest people I've ever encountered Especially to a patient saying she's in pain Really upsetting ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,If I could give 0 stars I would Had multiple visits over the past year and all have been terrible Over an hour wait each time and no interest in personal concerns besides just prescribing medicine ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,The office environment: rushed cold Staff interaction with patients: impersonal demeaning Throughout the visit nurses and Dr Parekh offer minimal eye contact and are obsessively typing notes into the computer leading to poor communication a need to repeat oneself and distraction On multiple occasions I was asked to reiterate my pain points confirming my belief that the doctor was not listening to me as intently as I wished Advice to patients: you want to be under the care and supervision of an individual who is able to connect with you through thorough communication Bedside manners are incredibly important At this office you will feel rushed from the time you enter to when you are asked for a copay The receptionists  Weymouth office  are quite unpleasant and snippy This has been a learning experience Heed my advice so you may avoid discovering for yourself ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,I felt like the Dr didnt want to sit and listen to my questions She seem to be really rush trying to get out of the door when I still had questions I told her my left arm was hurting it felt heavy and I have chest pain She examined my arm and said How long did you say your shoulder has been hurting it seems like a muscle issue to me I am a 52 year old African American women and I was more concerned about my heart The Doctor seemed to be more concerned about moving on to her next patient ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,I have seen Dr Parekh multiple times over the last year or so and all my meetings with her have been very professional timely with plentiful advice ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Viduri_Parekh html, Viduri P Parekh ,I have a very long and complicated medical history and Dr Parekh took the time to listen and take thorough notes we ran out of time for an actual physical and she immediately set up a convenient time for me to come back to finish up ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,Didn't give me time to explain very monotone expression less and degrading,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,Dr McDonald is an excellent doctor and a truly nice person He cares about his patients and is very thorough I have always felt safe with him directing my care which is why I highly recommend Dr McDonald ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,Dr McDonald is an excellent doctor and a truly nice person I find him to be very patient even when I'm not at my best during an appointment He looks at the Whole person not just the illness ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,I have the opportunity to see Dr McDonald He is courteous happy like and nice person and will treat you accurately He will figure things out for you that other PCPs can't figure it out and takes care of it on the spot ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,What a wonderful first visit Dr McDonald put me at ease immediately and was very attentive to my concerns His diagnosis was accurate and my condition got better immediately I feel very comfortable at his office His staff is warm and friendly and I have not had to wait to see him  he is always on time I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a good family physician ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,This was the most unbelievable experience of my life This doctor was late for his appointment he was short and rude he appeared to have no idea what he was doing or talking about I will never go back to Dr McDonald ever again I went to another practice shortly after my horrendous visit here and was accurately diagnosed with something completely different that what Dr McDonald diagnosed me with I would not recommend an enemy to see this man for any reason ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,I had Congestive Heart Failure a little more than 3 years ago and and had to follow up with Dr McDonald on a regular basis for my INR's I am in excellent health now through changing my life  no alchohol or nicotine lots of exercise etc  and with the constant encouragement of Dr McDonald He is an excellent doctor looking at the overall health of the patient instead of just curing a particualr malady I have read other posts on this board to the contrary and I felt I have weigh in with my experience I wish him the best in Ohio He is the best primary care doctor I have ever had INR's are a hassle but that is not Dr McDonalds fault You have to do them so why not use them as a chance to get a check up on how you are progressing instead I look at doing INR's on a regular basis as a form on Connected Medicine,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,Do not follow up with patients By all means Do not take there symptoms seriously Pretend the patient is drug seeking instead of sending them to a specialist to be looked at even when they say I am not looking for medicine I am looking for a doctor Afraid to prescribe medication If you are going to become a doctor don't forget that you treat patients with medicine sometimes Except Dr McDonald or should I say Kip Dynamite That's right I said it he is Napoleon's brother Kip Next time you see him listen closely Overall this doctor sucks and will not take your concerns into consideration GOOD LUCK OHIO,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,Changed two years ago to Dr McDonald and he by far is the best primary care Dr I have ever had Very attentive to my concerns right on the money for prescribing the right meds that help my blood pressure and chlosterol And just a down to earth doctor ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,Extremely frustrated with dr He did not take my symptoms seriously after a number of attempts and still yet to be directed to a correct specialist Unbelievable when a primary care dr thinks symptoms are made up He completely read me wrong and didn't want to research the lagitamcy of my symptoms I absolutely can't recommend a doctor that isn't willing to continue to learn,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_L_Mcdonald html, William L Mcdonald ,W McDonald Because I didn't use your lab to get an INR and see you for an office visit each time where I would loose 3 6 hours of work time every month for 1 to 2 visits you couldn't read my INR sent to you for 4 months in a row by and outside lab or just leave me a 1 minute voice mail with an INR number You could have killed me by your accounts of the requirements for cumadin use I have 4 kids what were you thinking After 20 years on this medication I might have more insight on its use and dosage but can't get the information without Dr  stamp The information serves the patient as well as the doctor At the end of the day all it serves is the patient ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_S_Friedman html, William S Friedman ,I have been a patient for 22 years and he has delivered all of my kids Great friend and doctor I don't always like to hear what he has to say but his is always right and I respect his knowledge and expertise ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_William_S_Friedman html, William S Friedman ,Been A patient of Dr Friedman for at least 25 years maybe longer He is an excellant Dr  as well as a man of compassion I can discuss openly anything on my mind I'm glad I have him as my Dr ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Youko_Yeracaris html, Youko G Yeracaris ,I went to Dr Y 6 years ago as someone who had always been healthy and active A friend referred her to me as I was gaining weight even though I was doing marathons and triathlons  constant yeast infections sensitivity to soaps and shampoos Chronic fatigue depression anxiety and a chronic cough that had lasted for 9 months She tested all of my body functions down to the cellular level and discovered that my magnesium was dangerously low my yeast was high and that I had several food sensitivities I was put on a rotation eating program which had all regular foods and several supplements The cough left in 3 days I lost 25 lbs without any excercise at all and I was able to get off antidepressants and have not had to take them since My insurance covered Percentage of the costs but it was out of pocket up front If you are willing to take responsibility for your own health them this I the dr for you I was given several prescriptions to help with my issues by my primary that only addressed the symptoms It didn't heal me Dr y healed me from the inside out My husband is in pharmaceuticals so I believe in them But Neither he or I can discount the results of alternate therapies as a part of a comprehensive whole body health approach,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Youko_Yeracaris html, Youko G Yeracaris ,When I was a young teen I had suffered years and years of embarassing plantars warts on my hands feet knees and elbows I spent tons of time money pain and ugly scarring trying to get rid of these at the dermatologist only to be repeatedly disppointed and embarrased to show my body in public with the warts and the unsightly scars and coloring after freezing them off I was doubtful of 'alternative medicine' but my mother insisted we give it a try She prescribed a single homeopathic dose of pellets that dissolved under my tongue and tasted like sugar I was very pessimistic but within a few weeks they disappeared and never returned I recall her taking a lot of time to get to know me as an individual which I almost never receive from an MD It was refreshing that she consdered my entire self in her approach I have never had a doctor like her and probably never will again So if you have an open mind and can display patience with what appears to be her struggle in practicing solo I think the rewards will be profound I highly recommend her with my utmost confidence The irony  I work at a pharmaceutical company I beleive in what she does and I trust her She is a great doctor and person Thanks for reading ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Youko_Yeracaris html, Youko G Yeracaris ,As a know patient with Celiac I went to Dr Y to diagnose and treat lingering stomach problems I was still getting sick even following a gluten free diet I craved sugar constantly Dr Y did diagnostic testing to get at the root of my food sensitivities and placed me on supplements to address my issue Four weeks later and I have never felt this good in my entire life I have not gotten sick once My energy level has improved ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Youko_Yeracaris html, Youko G Yeracaris ,I met Dr Yeracaris in 2007 after seeing many of the leading doctors in Boston She was my doctor of last resort as I was still without a concrete diagnosis for what appeared to be a case of Chronic Fatigue Her approach comes from a blending of her western medical degree and many years of practice with a very strong influence from her studies of eastern medicine and an innate medical intuition I view her as a complement to my primary doctor and other specialists I have seen during my life She assesses the total person and does not rely on obvious symptoms or off the shelf diagnosis I credit Dr Y with diagnosing my ailment s  and giving me a non invasive and healthy approach to mending my body which was very broken Her methods may be perceived as unorthodox Her office is a one woman practice and she often is not as organized as one might expect However none of this has ever impacted the guidance and good medical advice she has delivered to me over the past 4 years ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Youko_Yeracaris html, Youko G Yeracaris ,Smart lady with lots of knowledge but has lots of trouble staying focused She's helped me over the years but I'm getting sick of her shenanagans like full voicemail and can't leave message broken fax machine doesn't answer phone so my primary care has no way to communicate with her not to mention me not getting an insurance referral after 2 months of my repeated attempts and promises made to me She goes through office people like Murphy Brown ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Youko_Yeracaris html, Youko G Yeracaris ,1500 dollars after she screamed at us and got offended with our questions her treatments did nothing And she lied about her education She is crazy Don't go find yourself a nice hospital to deal with your issues ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Worst doctor I've ever had Very condoscending to say the least Will make you feel like you're a circus freak to her colleagues She should not be allowed to practice ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,The most caring doctor that I have ever met She is alaways on call when I am sick Very smart and accurate with her diagnosis Thank God for Dr Yuko,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Dr McColgan is the kind of doctor I remember from growing up She cares She listens She acts in the patient's best interest This is an amazing physician who is a generalist in an age of specialists As a Family Physician she takes care of your WHOLE body and mind and only refers to specialists when indicated Please know that Dr Yuko  as I call her  delivers Concierge Style Medicine but without the associated costs She and her husband  also a physician  drove me home after a colonoscopy because I don't have any relatives in the area That kind of care is amazing I think that Dr Yuko is still taking new patients And not only that but she'll stay later in the evening if you can't come during work hours Unbelievable ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,The only good thing was being able to get an appointment I've never had a doctor yell at me before I'll never forget the way she made me feel and I thought going to a dr was supposed to make you feel better I didn't even want to rate one star for especially bedside manner but it was the only option I believe the ratings on the first half are from real patients and the back half are either written by herself and/or her friends Go elsewhere from a patient to another ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Yesterday I went to Dr McColgan's office for cheking as usual Dr McColgan did neccesary tests and explained to me with politeness what I really want to know  Anytime she relieves me from the fear of illness with wam smile I think she is very professional and believe that she makes correct diagnosis for me I can Not understand that she is rude awkward  from my experience for 3years ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,I would never recommend her to anyone She's awkward uncaring makes WRONG diagnosis and wastes your time GO ELSEWHERE,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,I have been going to Dr McColgan for years and she is constantly aware of my medical history with each comment she makes If you inform her of everything that is going on she is always right on the money with the cure I have never had a doctor who is as responsive and helpful as Dr McColgan I will continue to go to Dr McColgan for years to come ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Her office is now in MA and there are many Japanese patients there because she speaks Japanese but her speech is so rude She pretends as if she know everything and often gives me unhelpful advice for my kids though she has little knowledge about pediatrics She never apologizes even if she makes fundamental mistakes ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Would never recommend her terrible doctor She is condescending and difficult to work with,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,takes everything personal misdiagnoses rude,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Difficult rude and flat out not good at her job She recommended an epidural for my shoulder pain Really I didn't get it Then after the MRI she said yeah you aren't showing anything that would've needed an epidural Ummm ok Good thing google knows more than you and I'm paying you for nothing Referrals to out of network doctors Yes my insurance is fine with it This doctor No sorry Only will refer to people she works with It's my choice to see whatever doctor I choose ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,I have been seeing Yuko for several months now but I will not go back She doesn't seem to care about me or my problems After a recent physical which lasted only about 10 minutes I brought up some problems I was having She failed to even try to find the cause of any of them I am definitely finding a new doctor ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,Dr McColgan did not do anything with me because he was prepared by her friend He showed prejudice and asked unethical question why I did not stay with my previous doctor She did not ask though what I expected from this visit and I had a lot of mediucal problems and was less than a month afetr a major surgery It was the worst experience in my life After this visit my blood pressure and blood sugar went 50 points up ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,I usually don't take the time to give reviews but Dr McColgan and her team really deserves it I came down with a bit of a cold and needed to go away for a weekend Foolishly I waited till I got worse before calling on the morning the day before my trip Thankfully they're much more organized than me Corey the receptionist put me right in and I was in the office seeing Dr McColgan herself within 30 minutes after my call Dr McColgan is very open and genuine She makes me feel very optimistic and in control about my health and healthcare Her and her staff have shown me a lot of respect and courtesy I feel comfortable talking about my most embarrassing health issues with them I have a very very high opinion of Dr McColgan and her staff ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,I was able to make my appointment very quickly and the waiting time was less than 5 min I liked the fact that when I was sick she was able to see me right away ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,The staff spoke Japanese to each other in front of me The medical assistant didn't seem to know what she's doing And overall the staff was not professional Location is great Dr McColgan was nice and knows her stuff She is a cheerful lady ,2,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Yuko_Mccolgan html, Yuko Mccolgan ,I called dr Mccolgan office to see dr since I had pain and discomfot on upper rite site on my stomach receptionist set up an appoinment for me the same day and when doctor came to the room I was waiting for her she brought a medical student with her did not asked me if it's ok with me and instead of asking what is my problem started to lechure me in aggresive and hostile tone why I did not come to see her again after my last visit  She just started to see patients back in Sep 2010 and since my PCP for many years left her practice to persue a different carier I came to see Dr Macclogan to get to know her not for a medical reason  I was in pain did not have any food from the night before and it was 2:30 pm I was absolutely speachless hearing all these never before in my life seen such unproffesional and rude behavior from any doctor towasrd patient in need Only after asking Dr Mccolgan if she refuses to see me she started very aggresively to palpitate my belly It seems that her primary concern is to get patient to her office as many times as possible and I had a talk ty her another patient that she overlooked a pnemonia case for that she was forsed to come to Dr Mccolgan every week no wonder that the only feedback I found for this doctor on the internet is poor Completely agree ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zainab_Nawab html, Zainab A Nawab ,Dr Nawab is one of the best doctors I have ever seen She is an excellent diagnostician along with being caring and professional She is prompt and always spends the appropriate time for me Her office staff is also courteous and professional I would give Dr: Nawab a higher rating if possible ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zbigniew_Dombek html, Zbigniew Dombek ,I came to this doctor after my insurance was changed and I no longer have access to my old PCP of 10 years I been experiencing challenges with allergies which seem to continuously become worse as time progress I also needed to talk about other conditions to which I need a specialist This doctor was literally rude disrespectful and assumptions He disregarded my concerns He did not take the time to ask questions to understand what is going on He assumed I lived with my mother he was questioning the medications I take and telling me I should not be taking medications without even allowing me to explain or reading my medical records He said he had not received my records but the old hospital record department reported to have sent them the day I called before the visit with this DR Instead of feeling like I was expressing my concerns I felt like I had to defend myself because I was literally being attacked He should retire if he no longer finds fulfillment in his work ,1,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zbigniew_Dombek html, Zbigniew Dombek ,We just moved into the area and the first doctor that our plan sent us to was part of a clinic and they where not what we wanted so we canceled We found Dr Dombek and my wife went first and I second It was awesome to find a REAL family doctor He spent at least 40 minutes with each of us He was very attentive to our needs answered our questions and questioned us on our goals His office staff was awesome also We had no problems in scheduling new appointments ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zbigniew_Dombek html, Zbigniew Dombek ,Excellent care and a very efficiently run office ,5,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zbigniew_Dombek html, Zbigniew Dombek ,Dr Dombek is often times brusque but one must weigh that against his ability to diagnose and treat the various ailments of mankind He is thorough but I sometimes leave his office wanting to cry at his shortness but I return because I know he will take care of me ,4,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zbigniew_Dombek html, Zbigniew Dombek ,Howcome everytime I try to call the office I get a busy signal The only time the phone rings is when the answering service is on call I dont know what is going on there but the phone system has got to be addressed ,3,
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Zbigniew_Dombek html, Zbigniew Dombek ,Refused me a simple chest xray because I didn't have a fever despite cough history of pneumonia Wound up hospitalized almost died due to delayed treatment Absolute quack with no bedside manner ,1,

https://www vitals com/doctors/1zzk0x/kateri-mccarthy,Kateri Mccarthy,I liked Dr Mcarthy immediately Her warm demeanor put me at ease She listened intently to my concerns and I believe that her compassion was truly genuine The one complaint that I do have is that her receptionist are very disorganized and a couple of them are really rude I've had multiple appointments canceled without notification and I had to call to reschedule I received an attitude after all this Despite this inconvenience I still find keeping Dr McCarthy as my pcp to be worth it ,5,

https://www healthgrades com/providers/rosalyn-kenney-32y9v,Rosalyn Kenney ,I have been with Roz and her staff for 7 months She found the medical issue I had struggled with for years that every other doctor dismissed She thinks outside of the box when things are complex and yes she will refer you to a specific specialist if the issue gets too complex she does this so you can receive the best care possible The office is extremely busy and Roz takes the time with every single patient she has The practice does have a web portal which is very helpful and user friendly,5,
https://www healthgrades com/providers/rosalyn-kenney-32y9v,Rosalyn Kenney ,I was sent a letter reccomending I should seek a physician which could help me basically they dismissed me The office has told my husband on a few occasions I was a challenge due to the fact I have health anxiety It's very unfortunate they gave up on me during a time of need Also the office takes a while to call you back and the front desk is still learning how to use he phone system From a technology standpoint they are way behind in the times They lack a Web portal and don't do email ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/providers/rosalyn-kenney-32y9v,Rosalyn Kenney ,Roz Kenney is a dedicated caring intelligent and compassionate practitioner that deserves many thanks for the care she has provided during the last four years of managing my chronic illness She gives 100 plus to her patients whom she truly does treat like family Her staff is courteous and efficient and they are very accommodating The difference is night and day from my previous primary care practice I can't say enough good things about Roz she is wonderful and Im grateful for her ,5,

https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Seeing these low rated reviews of Dr Vafidis is disheartening because myself my sick mother and father all see him as our primary care and he caught an early stage of cancer in my mother by doing great due diligence we had no idea Giving my mom the earliest notice by running extra tests no one else ran gave my family extra time with our elderly mother who SURVIVED cancer He really cares for us like he would family so I am so grateful and recommend Dr Vafidis for this reason ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Do not go to see this doctor if you are sick Went to the walk in very ill Spent less than 5 minutes with me and sent me on my way saying he wasn't convinced I was sick Went to another walk in directly from there and was diagnosed with the flu Just terrible ,1,

https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,customer service sucks ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Absolutely phenomenal doctor I have had to come in a few more times than usual over the past year for primary care visits and at least a couple of times I have overheard in the hallway other patients saying to him I would't be alive if it weren't for you  or you saved my life  I don't doubt that this is true Service by him and his staff is always prompt and I feel so comfortable with him I feel like he truly cares about my health Definitely a gem of the healthcare system in RI ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Professional and answered all my questions Very accommodating and was in and out with no wait time Highly recommend ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Wow A doctor who actually believes what I am saying about my symptoms and doesn't have to run a million expensive tests This is pretty amazing Urgent care just got so much better,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,I was in and out in an hour with no appointment on a Sunday evening They got an exam in for a foot injury an X ray and even delivered my prescription to the pharmacist electronically I was totally preparing myself for several hours Besides the speed of service they're very friendly and have a very clean comfortable facility ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,It wasn't my experience it's my daughters she was going to d Vafidis for 7 years were he provided her with pain med and anxiety among other medicine she has a chronic condition Doctor Vafidis has a very Rude office manager named Nicholas Nicholas called my daughter regarding a outstanding bill which she made payment arrangements with the way he spoke to her was very unprofessional and my daughter called the office and complained My daughter was excused from practice for no reason without her,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Being in healthcare myself and knowing the challenges of running a practice I would not recommend Dr Vafidis or his walk in center Staff appeared to be scattered due to a lack of organization but were friendly and polite Dr Vafidis however lacks the patience and communication skills to effectively treat any patient with his arrogant and rushed ways,2,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-constantine-vafidis-3try5, Constantine Vafidis ,Dr Vafidis is truly an exceptional Dr  who listens intently and asks pertinent before recommending treatment He discusses overall health in addition to the specific complaint This was my second experience at the Warren Ave walk in I have been well cared for Excellent ,5,

https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-geoffrey-burns-28mky, Geoffrey Burns ,The best doctor I have had in my adult life Dr Burns is the best He is very knowledgeable and spends a LOT of time understanding his patients and explaining treatment options He cares a GREAT deal for his patients and is an asset to the medical profession I used to live near his practice and then moved to New Hampshire Recently I decided the 1 5 hour drive is worth it and switched back to him Dr Burns was gracious enough to accept me again I trust him with my life as health ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-geoffrey-burns-28mky, Geoffrey Burns ,Dr Burns has been my family physician for over 10 years If I could give him 10 stars I would ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-geoffrey-burns-28mky, Geoffrey Burns ,Dr Burns is fantastic This is the kind of doctor all others should strive to be like He is genuinely caring attentive patient and very knowledgeable While speaking with Dr Burns I got the immediate impression that he has vast knowledge on a variety of subjects I believe this is important because it keeps the mind fresh and alert  I have known jaded doctors that barely look up from writing their notes  Dr Burns is a true renaissance man in his quest for continuing excellence ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-nasim-ghaffar-xvpv7, Nasim Ghaffar ,We have been her patients since moving to Massachusetts in 2008 She has always been available when we need her Sent my daughter for emergency Cat Scan where an abdominal cyst was discovered and arranged for consult and surgery within the week in Boston Waiting in a doctors office is normal I ve waited 15 minutes  45 minutes even an hour But she gives me the time I need when in examination room Insurance companies dictate the 15 minute scheduling Glad to have chosen her as our doctor ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-nasim-ghaffar-xvpv7, Nasim Ghaffar ,Dishonest Avoid at all costs Tried to find ways for you to come in again to charge your insurance and you more than necessary ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-nasim-ghaffar-xvpv7, Nasim Ghaffar ,Uses a reputability unprofessional lawyer to collect her penny debts My $110 dollar bill is now a $300 dollar bill after interest and fees because they decide to send it to me FIVE YEARS later Not to mention the lady's always been rude and not the brightest bulb on the tree,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Well he appears to have no interest in diagnosing a patient and he has a malpractice case from 2014 Enough said about him Please find yourself another doctor ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Terrible Just found out after reading on this site that Dr Gustafson has been sued for malpractice It doesn't surprise me after my recent experience Just wished I had check him out beforehand ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,This review is based off my initial consultation with Dr Gustafson and his team I have personally been on the hunt for a more personable PCM with a focus on bedside manner and competency In the past year I have had three PCM's which none fit the bill nor met the requirements I looked for in a PCM I cannot say that is the case with Dr Gustafson and his team From entering and checking in to the consultation itself I couldn't have felt more comfortable I have faith this patient/doctor/medical team relationship will continue to meet my every expectation ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,The staff is a joke They were too busy discussing a concert they planned to attend to even acknowledge me It seemed each of them decided to let the other take my name at check in When I finally saw the dr  he was just as unprofessional  doesn't even make eye contact Now I know why since I see from this site that he has malpractice claims against him I should have been able to guess that just from my first visit I'm grateful to HealthGrades for posting dr malpractice information ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Seems so disconnected from his patients Won't go back ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Just got back from my first visit with Dr Gustafson It was so awful I immediately searched for what others experienced with him I should have done this before my visit Now I see that my experience is not unique I will never go there again ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,I just found this site after researching Dr Gustafson AFTER my appointment Big mistake Why didn't I check him out online first This guy truly should not be practicing medicine I had no idea he had malpractice claims lodged against him I am so grateful this site has this information Now I just have to remember to check here BEFORE going to a new doctor ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,MALPRACTICE No thanks Dr Gustafson ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,The reviews are helpful but really unnecessary since his Malpractice claims tell you everything you need to know about him  Stay Away ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Please if you are reading this you can do better  much better than this doctor ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,I really don't think Dr Gustafson cares about his patients I waited for over an hour to see him and then he told me he only has five minutes for me since he was leaving the office early I really don't want to go back ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,I LOVE Dr Gustafson and his staff I have been going to him for years and have NEVER had any issues The staff always does there best to get you in the very same day you call if you have something you need to urgently see him for They are very pleasant and caring Does the doctor run a little late sometimes Of course tell me a doctors office that doesn't You are never rushed and he does take the time and all steps needed to get to the bottom of the issue I trust him and his staff ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,With the charges of Malpractice in 2014 that resulted in a large settlement to the patient I cannot imagine how anyone would still be going to this doctor But unfortunately I also went to him  twice  I quickly realized he didn't have a clue what he was doing This prompted me to do some research and I found his Malpractice charges as well as this informative site I just hope Gustafson doesn't permanently injure anyone else due to his arrogant demeanor and sub par medical skills ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Terrible I should have read these reviews before going to this guy All the poor reviews are true ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,I am a fomer patient of Dr Gustafson I found him to be a very kind and caring doctor I had a hard to diagnose condition and he stuck through it with me for many months to figure out what was wrong and then referred me to a wonderful specialist I never felt rushed in appointments and he listened to my problems and tried to find sout ions instead of throwing pills at them as a lot of doctors tend to do If I hadn't moved away I would definitely have continued to be a patient of his ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,He's ok but his office staff is useless I went about a month ago with a raging ear infection and was unfortunate enough to get his newer NP She told me I may not have an infection and that I should come back  $$  if it didn't clear up It didn't and I made other arrangements I received a bill for $265 because the staff bungled the paperwork I'm tired having to get lucky with this crew and so changed doctors Also be prepared to wait at every visit ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,I'm not sure where all the bad reviews are coming from I've been a patient of dr Gustafson's since I was a kid and the only bad thing I could ever say about the office was the nurse practitioners that they have had over the years who have been awful however the current nurse practitioner as of today's date is the best I've ever seen in that office and I feel very comfortable with Her diagnosis As for dr Gustafson he is the best of the best Very knowledgeable right to the point good Doc,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,We often recommend Dr Gustafson and his staff to friends that are both new to the area and those that have been here for years and are looking for a change He is a very brilliant Godly man who motivates not only children promoting them in the Lord but also my non believing friends have taken so much from his power of example He provides effective and effeficient healthcare solutions conveniently on his office ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-craig-gustafson-xkv7j, Craig Gustafson Jr ,Dr Gustafson is the worst doctor I ever encountered There really is no other way to put it His condescending attitude is used to mask his lack of medical skill I went to him because I live only a few miles from his office In doing so I sacrificed competence for convenience I read the reviews and ignored all the negative ones Big mistake on my part ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,Truly goes above and beyond to help her patients,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,Dr Qutab is a first rate physician She is kind caring & certainly knows her stuff She is always there when needed and always has a remedy for whatever problem arises I would highly recommend Dr Qutab she's the best ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,While Dr Qutab is a kind person the running of her office is very poorly managed Firstly her hours are not at all conducive to a medical facility and the realistic needs of patients She has varied hours M Th and is closed on Fridays requiring you to go to Urgent Care for any treatment needed Many times prescriptions have not been called in accordingly and I end up finding out once I've arrived at the pharmacy The office staff has no idea what they're doing very unhappy with my care ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,I have been a patient of Dr Qutab since 2013 I have no complaints I am not going anywhere ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,Dr Qutab is wonderful She is dedicated intelligent professional and most of all she genuinely cares That is a rare hens' teeth in today's world The office staff is an extension of Dr Qutab They go over and beyond the call of duty ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,Dr Qutab is the best doctor for me I have been a patient of hers for about 3years she has found problems with my health that a lot of doctors could not find She has helped me in many ways she cares about her patient health Plus she is a GP so she takes care of all your health needs My husband and I were looking for a new doctor and we couldn't have found a better one I would give Dr Qutab a five star rating I would recommend this doctor to my friends and family of which I have ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,I'll recommend Dr Qutab anytime to my friends and family I live at an hour from her office but I prefer to drive that far to see her She is very warm and listen to your concerns She takes the time to explain what's is happening and what can be done to make it better She's quick at giving you the right referrals for specialists and follow up with you about your health concerns She also calls specialists to make sure that you are adequately followed ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,Dr Qutab takes the time to find out what is wrong with you and what is happening at home that could affect your health She really listens We are very lucky to have her here in our little town ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,I have been a patient of Dr Qutab for about 7 years Her office hours are extremely slim only four days a week no Friday availability and 9am 1pm most days I live close by but work in Boston but kept her for the connection I felt we had I called to make an appt and was told that I haven't seen her in 3 years I saw her just 15 months ago for a physical Her receptionist is cold and rude Dr Qutab has changed  she is not the same warm doctor she used to be Very unfortunate ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-raffia-qutab-x33gb, Raffia Qutab ,She tells you how she takes so few patients so that she can give you the time and then she is just absent doesn't do what she says she will do She writes a prescription the insurance denies it she doesn't get back to you I ended up having a heart attack I called her office while in the recovery room never got a phone call never got a visit I feel as though she sold herself as something completely different than what she is ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-david-coia-2kjjn, David Coia ,DR Coia is GREAT He answers all my Questions Takes his time ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-david-coia-2kjjn, David Coia ,Was not able to answer any of my questions about my Crohn's disease He said there is no research on it and all that is known it that it's contagious It is NOT contagious and when I tried to explain this to him he just rolled his eyes I told him I am taking anti inflammatory meds but they don't seem to been helping me He then oddly recommends that I take Ambien telling me recent research suggests this will solve your problem I told him that is a sleeping aid He did not make any sense ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,The rudest staff I have been a patient for 11 years but no more No manners and they do not listen ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,1000 percent would recommend him and his staff ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,Dr Romanowski is knowledgable thoughtful rational conscientious and direct His staff is friendly and efficient Easy to get appointments If a problem is outside his expertise he will refer you immediately to a specialist ,4,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,anyone that would go to him is a fool He is the worst dr in the area  shouldn't be still in practice,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,Male doctor with young female interns Not ideal for men's health Doesn't do continued referall unless he gets to bill your insurance each year Cancelled appointment on their end and didn't submit referral Very rushed appointments ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,Rushes you through appointment He told me I had something that I don't even have Had to go t9 urgent care because of it Not a very good doctor ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-romanowsky-x6gt5, Michael Romanowsky ,Rushes you thru the appointment doesn't listen and forget to call in my medicine for my illness Poor care to say the least,1,

https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-anne-barry-g9cx3, Anne Barry ,Based on incomplete information Dr Barry told me I had MS It took two months to get to an MS Specialist  two months of hell  who told me that I DID NOT have MS Another time I saw her with general body pain lasting months She ordered a hip x ray and told me I had arthritis in my hip  thus explaining the TOTAL body pain   when I suggested that Simvastatin can cause such pain she agreed that I should stop it and see what happens Pain went away No replacement med was ordered ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-harveen-singh-2df94, Harveen Singh ,Dr Singh is one of the best She has helped me so many times with health issues and when I leave her office I've thought that I know I will be getting better and I am so lucky to have her as a doctor She has also helped my daughter and grand daughter we all have confidence in what Dr Singh says Wish we knew her before ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-harveen-singh-2df94, Harveen Singh ,Dr Singh is a great doctor however she is a private practice with very limited availability and its nearly impossible to get someone on the phone Not convenient if you actually need something or need a question answered I would recommend that she join a larger group or hire staff that actually helps her patients ,2,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-harveen-singh-2df94, Harveen Singh ,She is not a caring doctor She is very rude and deceitful I saw her for about a year and a half and towards the end of her treatment she treated me with utter disrespect Dont have her treat you I highly recommend looking elsewhere ,1,

https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-jeffrey-gorodetsky-y53f7, Jeffrey Gorodetsky ,Dr Jeffrey Gorodetsky overlooked my cancer for 45 days during his practice in FL His staff was never empathetic and sent me to 5 ultrasound x rays over a 6 week period and a 35 pound weight loss with horrific gut pain The only time we heard from the doctor was after we demanded a CT Scan  we received a phone call message indicating the radiologist found pancreatic cancer The voice mail wished us luck and recommended we find an oncologist STAY FAR AWAY from Dr Jeffrey Gorodetsky,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,I have been going here for 10 years the entire staff is friendly and helpful I highly recommend the entire staff they are a very busy office for a reason ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,The best of the best I am a new patient couldn't be happier so relieved what a gem I found,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,I have been going to Dr Sullivan for about 20 years She is the first Doctor that I feel that each and everytime I go to her she is totally listening to what I tell her She is unbelievably patient and caring/,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,She is very intelligent and very easy to talk to and you actually get to see her one on one which I like and she take the time to explain and talk to you about your concerns her staff is very friendly and helpful ,4,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,My primary care retired after having her for thirty years and I was given Dr Sullivan by my insurance Although it can be harder to get an appoint with her specifically when I was able to see her I found her to be very intelligent knowledgeable and very nice She likes to explain everything which I find a very good quality for doctors she cares if you understand the things she is explaining and take the time if you need more information ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,She's intelligent obviously but classless and unprofessional Makes you feel like you are an idiot and being a burden The secretaries are worth laughing at and they feel entitled to do whatever they please However the nurses are awesome ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,I was assigned Dr Sullivan at the beginning of this year [2017] with the start of my new health insurance plan I called her office to set up an appointment and even though she was/is currently taking new patients was refused care I think it may be a blessing in disguise I may have dodged a bullet here I can't give Dr Sullivan any real stars as I didn't get past the guards to even see her What I can say is calling her office was a waste of my time just short of a joke ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,She is a fantastic doctor and her supporting staff is beyond compare,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,The receptionists are friendly but I feel like I'm always on hold when I call Could just be a busy time of day The nurse that works there is rude and seems hostile I feel as though my concerns are not being taken seriously and my concerns are shot down and I'm being told that I am being crazy because of my concerns ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,I met Dr Sullivan to hopefully become my new primary care doctor I needed to see her quickly because I had discovered a lump in my breast To be fair the front desk did get me in quickly to see her for that But that is where anything good ended I wound up diagnosed with breast cancer And I have NEVER HEARD from the office about this Thank GOODNESS that the radiologist was able to give me a diagnosis and get me scheduled with a surgeon right away ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-iris-sullivan-xffh9, Iris Sullivan ,She's very knowledgeable very nice easy to talk to I like her ,4,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Dr Allara is the best He and his staff exemplify caring professionalism expertise and thoroughness Last Friday at 5pm I called his office because of a bug bite and what looked like cellulitis on my arm Dr Allara stayed and waited for me to get there examined me and prescribed an antibiotic for cellulitis saving me from a trip to Urgent Care on a Friday evening What was amazing was that he was glad that I called and happy to wait to make sure I was treated Dr Allara also made sure I knew what to look for in the event the cellulitis worsened and said that the Manchester office would be available on Saturday and his office available on Sunday I'm always a little nervous around doctors but his caring makes me feel comfortable and at ease ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Dr Allara from the Family Medicine in Middleton is one of the finest Family Physicians on the North Shore Dr Allara and his staff are very Professional and very interested in his patients health He always listens and answers my questions I have been a patient of his for many years and would highly recommend that Dr Allara and his staff be a trusted health care team for you and your love ones Thank you Dr Allara Johnny G ,5,

https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Dr Allara is wonderful Very passionate and interested in his patients and delivers personalized service ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,I love Dr Allara I have been a patient for over 5 years He is kind and takes time to listen He really cares I was worried about a test result and he personally called me back the same day with thankfully good news I would recommend him to anyone He is fantastic I worked for radiologists for years Dr Allara was the only doctor who knew exactly what to test for and helped getting patients proactive treatment He is the best of the best ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,My husband and I are new patients of Dr Allara Other members of our family are patients and suggested we see him I had met him while bringing another family member to him for a second opinion I was so impressed with his kindness and how comforting he was to the patient as well as those of us who were there for her We are now seeing him and are very pleased Everyone there is very friendly and very helpful We are very happy with the change The Mastrangelo's Peabody Ma ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Dr Allara is kind and considerate very knowledgeable and takes time to talk to his patients and listen to their concerns Even though you know each day is very busy for a Primary Care doctor he always takes the appropriate time to spend with you and you never feel like he is rushing out to see the next patient His treatment plans are great and most issues can be taken care of right in his complex ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Front office staff was never very helpful and recently when I went to another PCP instead of telling me they could transfer all my medical records directly to the new PCP at no charge they charged me $50 for the records I have seen Dr Allara for over 6 years and I found him to be friendly but non empathetic Over the years my blood counts have deteriorated and was sent to see specialist in a variety of fields with no conclusive results His reply from then forward was draw blood and watch ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Was my PCP for over 6 years and during that time my blood counts dropped but he kept telling me we will keep checking finally I got a new PCP in 2015 and within a month was diagnosed with cancer Many more details behind this but the gist is no empathy from this Dr and is more of a push you through and collect the money from the benefits ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,My family and I have been with Dr Allara for 16 years We have gotten to know many of the doctors and other staff in the practice It is helpful to view the practice as a whole as there are several doctors My husband and sons usually have appointments with Dr Allara but sometimes with others I generally have appointments with one of the nurse practitioners We have been happy with our treatment which has included several significant problems with my husband and a son's rare disease ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-mark-allara-2xmg2, Mark Allara ,Dr Allara was my PCP for over 2 years and I never met him I tried to book appointments with him but never could get in with him because he was always overbooked I had to see a nurse practitioner every time You would think that he would make some time for at least an initial visit but I didn't even get that He is the director of the practice which has gone downhill over the past year Look at the latest reviews around the web ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,I do not know what happened to this once fine physician I do know the difference between the small intestine and the liver Scary that she doesn't Her mother does billing and authorization she is totally INCOMPETENT and blames the patient for her failings Mother is rude condescending and a waste of oxygen Dr Mandel cannot keep an office nurse and has had 3 new ones this year alone My concern for the well being of her patients has lead me to file a complaint with the Board of Medicine ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,I have been going to Doctor Mandel for at least 10yrs now She has turned my entire life around for the better She has been able to identify quickly what others could not I've since then encouraged my mom daughter best friend and husband to see her for their needs and any one of them will tell you the same thing about her She has even called me in emergencies from her own cell phone just to make sure I was feeling better you don't see that often Great woman & fantastic doctor ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,Dr Mandel is very open and candid and does not make you feel rushed during an exam She does a great job obtaining as much information regarding any health issues/pains/etc as possible by asking the right questions and actively listening I've noted the negative reviews are not very informative  not exactly shocking but certainly disappointing  but healthcare is a two way street if you are not open with the Dr  there is only so much she can do to help you ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,She has changed a lot was very caring and concerned but now very cut & dry Always downplaying everything like most typical conventional dr's Not sure what made her change but I am looking for a new dr ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,Stay away Deceiving staff Ignorant physician ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,I've been seeing Dr Mandel for years now and even though I live an hour away still refuse to see anyone else She is genuine and caring By far the best doctor I've ever had ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,She is extremely helpful and caring towards each patient I find her interactions with me to be extremely genuine and I feel that she is always extremely helpful with any problems I am having ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,I think that Dr Mandel is a very intelligent and personal doctor I have been able to make appointments in a pinch and her staff has always been very helpful and efficient for me ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,I really liked her at first she explained things very well and seemed to be thorough She recommended me to a specialist because of my concerns and back pain and I was happy with this The specialist called her for notes on why she recommended me and she refused to send anything over It took me 2 months to get a response and the specialist never received any notes Her secretary said several times that she does not call patients I asked if I could email her and the response was still no,2,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-yuliya-mandel-34ptc, Yuliya Mandel ,You wait an ungodly amount of time in the room cold for her to come in My final straw was after I took a blood test and she was supposed to call me to walk me through the results I called to check on the results and was told she would call me back Called again after weeks and she basically told the person on the phone to relay my results without an explanation I had to insist to speak to her and her response when I complained was that it was normal that way ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-guidi-xnslt, Michael Guidi ,I would recommend Dr Guidi to anyone that is looking for a local doctor ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-guidi-xnslt, Michael Guidi ,Profiling I am saddened to see what two people have commented on Dr Guidi has always taken the time to diagnose whatever issue I have come in with Being with Dr Guidi for over 12 years I would suggest speaking up to him rather than posting on this site It's your care If you don't mention it to him then you won't get what you went for He will take care of you it's just a matter of being open and honest with him Thank you Dr Guidi for your services throughout the years ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-guidi-xnslt, Michael Guidi ,Yes without a doubt He has my best interest in mind and that is all that I ask Being to many different doctors over the years you see how doctors function I have been so pleased with Dr Guidi that I haven't left in years and I would follow him anywhere He finds a way to work through the stressful environment and takes his time with me ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-michael-guidi-xnslt, Michael Guidi ,I drive a long way to see Dr Guidi because of the service he provides When reading the previous reviews I was shocked to see what they were saying because of how Dr Guidi has always taken care of me and my family He always has our best interest in mind and I would not trust any other doctor with my care He is thoughtful listens intently and empathetic All while being extremely busy and having many patients waiting for his care Thank you ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,Dr G is a nice guy but like most PCPs he's trying to be all things to all people That in itself isn't bad but he really believes he's an expert in areas he clearly is not and will not admit to himself when he needs to research subjects and will jump to incorrect conclusions all too fast If you have a real issue that need diagnosis find another doctor If you know what you have and how it is treated take your chances ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,Very smart I trust his medical thinking and doesn't waste your time or money ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,I appreciate Dr Gagnon's no nonsense demeanor He takes the time to listen and I never wait more than five minutes ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,Very pleasant visit Doctor and staff were very pleasant All expectations were met ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,I appreciate his direct approach ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,Dr Gagnon was on call Dr Gagnon returned my call immediately He encouraged me to return the call in the middle of the night if I didn't feel better He put me right at ease I feel confident and very comfortable with his professional attitude and knowledge ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,I have always been treated well at Dr Gagnon's office Never felt rushed ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,Couldn't find my files in the office Didn't feel that he was familiar with my chart and history Twice I had a problem after a visit and NO return phone call Waiting room time isn't bad but then they leave you waiting in the back room No comment when it comes to the staff Karen the NP is helpful but the lack of return phone call from her too was disappointing This is twice that I gave Dr Gagnon a chance My son in law left found another doctor & a friend of mine is looking too ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-robert-gagnon-3yljm, Robert Gagnon II ,Staff is rude and very unprofessional terrible experience at this office I would not recommend this Dr To anyone ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Dr Imam is very competent and skilled who goes an extra mile to make sure his pts are well taken care of I trust his genuine concern towards his pts coz of his work ethics integrity and kindness I have observed over the years His accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan has constantly reassured me that I am in safe hands He and his team are very diligent with follow ups and accommodating their pts My family member and friends who are under his care also share a very high opinion of him ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,I have been under the care of Dr Imam for almost 4 years and I cldnt have been more content He is very professional yet creates an amicable and comfortable environment where I can openly discuss my concerns and he makes sure they are answered My trust in his abilities has only grown stronger because of his kind and fastidious approach which he compliments with his accurate diagnosis Also a very conscientious Dr who is very careful abt prescribing opioids coz of massive abuse crisis tht exists,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Great  very personable doctor who addresses all your concerns and follows up on all the tests diligently Also a very smart doctor with very accurate diagnosis ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Previous rating of him being a lousy doctor is true He leaves you to find your own solution to your medical problems He actually made me withdraw a previous complaint to administraion or he wouldnt see me He doesnt read patients medical records when they transfer to him and has suggested prescribing a med that I had an adverse reaction to  a deadly one  Doesnt listen to patients doesnt prescribe any pain meds no history of addiction or drug abuse Its Imam's way or the highway ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Dr Imam is a caring doctor The office is very accommodating & I am usually fit in the scheduled if I call for a sick visit If he is unable to see me there are always alternatives NP's or Urgent Care His office returns calls or addresses messages within a timely manner His staff has gone above and beyond to help me with appts/referrals or any concerns I may have I have referred numerous friends and family members to Dr Imam He also has evening hours which is awesome too ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Fantastic PCP highly intelligent and personable and spend enough time to address all my concerns Very Highly recommended,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Had to transfer to this Jewel of a Doctor due to Insurance reasons I jest he's not a Jewel He treated me like some piece of trash drug seeker I was told to switch primaries and have everything health record related sent over I signed off the paperwork This guy isn't a Doctor Doctors are supposed to help He did nothing Wasted an hour plus of my life did not refill my prescriptions I had everything in order I will not be coming back again I am very unhappy ,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,Exactly what the last review said he leaves it up to the patient to diagnose themselfs then they have to go to er cause he sucks so bad would never recommend to any one else worse doc I have ever dealt with,1,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-syed-imam-x85nq, Syed Imam ,He is great with me He is friendly and really takes his time to answer all my questions and listens to my what I have going on Even when I crazy google stuff and self diagnose prior to my appointment he listens without judgment and talks me off the ledge with kindness and understanding ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-emily-ackerman-2739d, Emily Ackerman ,She is very knowledgeable pleasant and thorough,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-emily-ackerman-2739d, Emily Ackerman ,Emily is ALWAYS on top of her game she covers all the basics Emily's staff is friendly and knowledgeable I'll stay with this office as long as I live in RI If your lucky enough to get in her practice  you will love her ,5,
https://www healthgrades com/physician/dr-emily-ackerman-2739d, Emily Ackerman ,Been going to her since she started probably close to 15 yrs Not the same has great personality but felt brushed off for the last couple of years Since Amy left the office is awful I've left 2 messages and have never received a call back I work in a doctors office that is UNACCEPTABLE Needless to say I will be leaving the practice My sister also went to her for many years and had the same problems And you are lucky if I call them 3 times in a year Truly disappointing,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christen-fragala-2xt27, Christen Fragala ,Absolutely the worst attitude and appearance by a so called Dr I have ever encountered Non caring and judgemental and is surely in the wrong field of work very unprofessional in her demeanor and actions shown while in her presence How any could possibly trust her as a Dr is beyond me ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christen-fragala-2xt27, Christen Fragala ,I absolutely LOVE Dr Fragala she's amazing I've always had a slight fear of the doctors and would always put off and stall any and every appointment until I met her She truly does care about her patience and goes above and beyond for them I've followed her through 3 cities now and couldn't picture anyone taking care of my entire family other than her so I did my best to get my whole family seen by her and they're very thankful for it She's so compassionate and very eager to help ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christen-fragala-2xt27, Christen Fragala ,Dr Fragala is the most amazing doctor I have ever had She is caring friendly and she will always listen You never have to wait for her I check in and he staff is already calling me in to be seen   I never get to read my book  I can always count on her and her staff Dr Christen Fragala is one amazing physician I have referred many people to her and they do also feel the same way And everyone needs to eat lunch so I am okay with waiting out in the hall until the office opens ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christen-fragala-2xt27, Christen Fragala ,This place is concerned with getting you in an out and billing your insurance as much as possible They will not refer outside of the Lowell General network no matter what insurance you have Its not about providing the best care possible for patients its about getting as much cash as possible Plan on seeing the RN and not the actual doctor Oh yah good luck getting someone on the phone and if you show up between 12 1 expect to wait in the hall as they lock the office so they can eat lunch ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christen-fragala-2xt27, Christen Fragala ,Dr Fragala is my PCP Dr Fragala seems to be a reasonable doctor per my single and only visit with her However the practice at her office her nurse practitioner and staff have serious issues My rating is for her office as she often have me see the nurse practitioners than herself ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,I've only met with her twice once with her nurse practitioner She's thorough and interested She asks for my input and she appreciates and asks me to participate in my health care I really like that ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,Worse Dr i have ever seen in my life Makes me feel so much better after reading these reviews I left her office in tears She was EXTREMELY rude to me She was on her laptop the whole time and when i tried talking It was like i was bothering her  She had no interest in listening to me and my concerns about what i was dealing with She continued to talk over me and made me feel completely uncomfortable I am someone that hates confrontation and it was like she was trying to argue with me ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,I'm so surprised by the reviews that said they found Dr Sciascia and her staff to be condescending and disinterested It is true that she types her notes throughout the appointment but I thought this was very common practice in the medical field these days Every physician that I see for my own health or my kids does the same thing I have been a patient of Dr Sciascia for years and have had a very positive experience with her and her staff I would highly recommend her ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,I've seen her a few times for my annual and this last time left her office in tears After reading the reviews it's somewhat comforting to know it wasn't just me She has also stared at her laptop and typed while saying mmhmm at each appointment At the last appointment she made me feel terrible about myself and offered no assistance with what I was struggling with She doesn't even seem to like interacting with patients so it's a wonder she ever became a physician in the first place ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,Probably the worse Dr Out there Her checkups are lazy scripted and she is non receptive of anything you the patient may think or say Her follow up questions often seem random or misplaced She is very disingenuous lacks empathy and just not nice This trickles down to her office staff which make you feel as if you are burdening them with your 30 second interaction All the while you are there tryin to get better classy I gave them 3 chances and i was done Dont waste your time ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,I left her office in tears I've seen her a few times and this last visit confirmed I'm changing Drs She spoke to me like I was a 5 yr old typing away at her laptop She remembered nothing nor referenced her notes so I was answering questions for her She was more concerned I filled out a paper for her audit stiff bed side manner lacks empathy ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sarah-sciascia-yjlyp, Sarah Sciascia ,Disappointed When I became quite ill I found her to be condescending Most of her time was spent typing her notes on the laptop instead of focusing on what I was telling her I left my last appointment with her in tears I've been a nurse for 20 years and was real disappointed on her level of listening to her patients,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-anne-marie-treadup-2qwpg, Anne Marie Treadup ,I requested an appointment to see the dr or an appointment for a strep culture with the office staff Over 8 hours later they returned my call and told me to go to the ER or urgent care because they were too busy yet then tried to schedule an annual checkup ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-anne-marie-treadup-2qwpg, Anne Marie Treadup ,Referred by Southcoast to make new patient appointment Was told Dr was accepting new patients Office staff told me she was not accepting new patients  she cut me off in mid sentence to give me another phone number to call and when I said thank you she just hung up and never even thanked me for calling Rude and extremely unprofessional ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,I've been with Dr Oheelan for 20yrs she saw my whole family and treated my boys great when needed for I'll es she reacted fast and put them as number one She is very personal I like that when your hospitalized or really ill she follows up on a weekend or holiday to assure you doing good Great dr,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,I've never had a doctor listen so intently during an office visit She asked me many questions took a lot of notes and I found her to be warm caring and very understanding Also I should note that the staff was friendly and attentive and I didn't have to wait longer to see the doctor ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,I would never recommend Dr OHeelan She rarely looks up from her computer screen when I am talking and makes me feel like she's not even listening to what I am saying The wait time for her is always 40+ minutes every time I see her and she spends about 7 10 minutes total with me She even performed a test on me without my consent or explaining what she was doing Very unhappy with her ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,Though we have been blessed with many excellent doctors over the years it is always a blessing to encounter one who listens to a fairly complex issue with patience and compassion Dr O'Heelan did just that at a time when my son and I most needed it ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,Last year I wrote a bad review of Dr O'Heelan after my annual appointment with her because I felt she made me wait longer than necessary and simply spouted off her standard recommendations to everyone during the examination I must acknowledge this year's annual exam was much better There was almost no wait time and she genuinely sought to understand my thoughts and concerns I'm not sure what changed between last year and this year but I am encouraged by the change ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,I had a wonderful experience with Dr O'Heelan She listened explained and I didn't feel rushed SHe schedule a follow up which I have already done with her Again she was great,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,I would never recommend Dr OHeelan to anyone I know She does not listen to the patient when you explain things Very rushed to send the patient to another specialist because she has no clue what is wrong with you Horrible that a sick patient is treated like this ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,She was walking out the door and standing in the hallway before I was even done discussing my concerns with her I've never felt so brushed off ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kate-oheelan-ymqwt, Kate O'Heelan ,She doesn't listen to the patient  goes strictly by the numbers,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,Dr Solomon is a kind and caring compassionate physician He is extremely patient and takes all his time with you no matter what your needs It's why he runs late some times Dr Solomon has been my Dad's physician for the last 5 years and has been amazing with him My Dad is 86 years old and sometimes cannot make the trip to the office and so Dr Solomon brings the office to him He has new staff and they are mature respectful and responsive I would highly recommend Dr Solomon ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,I had been seeing Dr Solomon for the past 20 years I've gotten to the point where I no longer trust him I have often waited over an hour just to get into the exam room then another 45 waiting to see him I've often not gotten phone calls back even if I left several messages He often has blamed all my conditions on my weight when I've had medical tests that shows that's not the case He is great when giving referrals to other physicians ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,Dr Solomon is a remarkable physician and person He has been my Family Physician for more than 20 years In the past several years he has had numerous employees who were not helpful to his practice He recently hired older employees who remind me of his previous staff They are kind and professional and do return phone calls There is something to be said for older employees ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,Dr Solomon is very nice but routinely over schedules his patients The wait time is easily over an hour The office staff is nice but no one ever answers the phone You go into a message box with several options but no matter which one you chose they don't return phone calls I've been going to Dr Solomon for over 20 years I would now consider finding a new Dr ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,A very poor experience here On the up side the staff is very nice The doctor is polite but not effective in my opinion The office wait times are frequently over an hour No luck getting test results or phone calls returned I have no faith in his abilities and found him dysfunctional and unorganized Misdiagnosed one condition and overlooked another that needed attention even though I accurately outlined the symptoms I found a new physician I wish I had done it sooner ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,I find Dr Solomon not only a great doctor but a very caring individual When I had my physical in 2016 he noticed a lump at the base of my throat that I was not aware of He referred me to a specialist it was discovered that I had second stage thyroid cancer I had two surgeries  im cancer free today Im extremely grateful to Dr Solomon and thank the Lord for his hands heart and faith,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,Dr Solomon has been my physician for 20 years Although the wait time may be long it is well worth it Dr Solomon treats the whole person takes time to understand the problem and answers questions thoroughly He is there for his patients He has returned my 3 a m phone call and helped me with the hospital too ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-solomon-2rwsk, John Solomon Jr ,Dr Solomon is genuinely a wonderful individual who truly cares about his patients I been a patient of his for 16 years Over the years I have notice the wait keeps getting longer and longer which yes can be and/or is frustrating BUT that's because if you go in to be checked for a simple cold he doesn't want to only know about your cold  he wants to know how you are doing physically mentally and emotionally He is a excellent Dr ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-wynne-huang-xhvvt, Wynne Huang ,I left this appointment feeling very uncomfortable The doctor was pretty rude and her nurse was too It seemed like the nurse didn't even want to be there Not only that but she seemed like she was getting irritated by my baby yelling and cooing I had to wait in the exam room for almost an hour when there was no one there I usually leave doctor's appointments feeling good but I felt extremely uncomfortable I wouldn't recommend her to anyone ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-richard-daly-yt352, Richard Daly ,Dr Daly is very uncaring and neglectful He prescribed a med for me that he knew I was allergic too It was written under allergies about 2 inches below his signature It could have been life threatening When I called the office and alerted them about it He never even had the common courtesy to call me himself to apologize He had his office manager do it Needless to say I will never go back to him again And if you do go to him you'd better check every thing he does ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-richard-daly-yt352, Richard Daly ,A doctor's appointment should be between you and your doctor  or NP   Having a SCRIBE attend every appointment is ridiculous  This violates every patients privacy and makes them feel extremely uncomfortable even if they say it is OK  Do you self a favor and have an employee  dressed in normal clothes  mention the scribe in the waiting room watch for the reactions I feel all Dr Daly does is try to hand out referrals anyways  Which costs patients money if they use them Come on Man ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-richard-daly-yt352, Richard Daly ,Healthcare is dramatically changing & patients feel like they are being treated like a number and not getting proper medical care but you will not find this with Dr Daly He is an excellent diagnostician on top of your care and treatment plan treats you like a person  not a # or diagnosis  Top Ranked PCP in New England by far and his staff is Stellar  Dr Daly other providers and Admin staff Franklin Family Practice are an example of what other Medical Practice should strive to be ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-harrison-2yft5, Rachel Harrison ,Chose this primary care physician based on her educational background and years of experience I should have researched her reviews of close to 2 5 out of 5 on many sites before I changed her to my doctor Dr Harrison is very aloof never responds to messages and walked out of the room in the middle of my physical before I could ask additional questions never saying goodbye and sent her PA in to give me a shot Worst doctor in my entire life Cannot put my health in this doctors hands ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-archana-shah-2c4fl, Archana Shah ,Dr Shah completely discounts whatever she's told She seems to feel she's the only accomplished dr in the world My first appointment with her I told her I'm type 1 diabetic She looked at me and said No you're not you're type 2  I explained that I'm not I'm under the care of a truly world class endo and Dr Shah said  Well I know you're type 2 I'd never listen to another dr tell me differently  Then she did unnecessary testing and found I'm type 1 She's horrible ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-archana-shah-2c4fl, Archana Shah ,PATIENTS BEWARE My experience was atrocious I 1st met with her for a pre physical & she spent the whole time typing The later physical began with staff insisting rudely that I did not complete bloodwork which they later found out was misfiled I spent the whole appointment repeating myself because she was either a  not listening or b  was forgetting what I said She focused on obscure concerns spoke in circles and contradicted herself  essentially she sounded completely incompetent ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-archana-shah-2c4fl, Archana Shah ,I have never had such a horrifying experience with a dr in my entire adult life I am writing to the board about her I needed full blood panel during physical never got it I am on Humira for psorisis and psoriatic arthritis I had a problem and she was suppose to report to Dermo never did so my psorisis flared so bad I need biopsis  skin cancer  I had severe back pain office manager came in and verbally abused me raising my blood pressure to 200  The Board will hear rest ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-zbigniew-dombek-xhb4p, Zbigniew Dombek ,I came to this doctor after my insurance was changed and I no longer have access to my old PCP of 10 years I been experiencing challenges with allergies which seem to continuously become worse as time progress I also needed to talk about other conditions to which I need a specialist This doctor was literally rude disrespectful and assumptions He disregarded my concerns He did not take the time to ask questions to understand what is going on He assumed I lived with my mother he was questioning the medications I take and telling me I should not be taking medications without even allowing me to explain or reading my medical records He said he had not received my records but the old hospital record department reported to have sent them the day I called before the visit with this DR Instead of feeling like I was expressing my concerns I felt like I had to defend myself because I was literally being attacked He should retire if he no longer finds fulfillment in his work ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-zbigniew-dombek-xhb4p, Zbigniew Dombek ,Dr Dombek is a disgrace From the first visit with him I did not have a good feeling My father who had had a stroke and was left very disabled became a patient of Dr Dombek after his original PCP retired Dr Dombek consistently questioned my care giving of my father He questioned whether I was giving him his meds how he was eating how he was caring for himself My father was very well cared for and he had no reason to think otherwise He was well fed well cared for and always had his meds I provided a level of care in his home that he would not have received anywhere else Dr Dombek's lack of compassion and and professionalism for my father's situation was disgusting ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-zbigniew-dombek-xhb4p, Zbigniew Dombek ,Granted Dr Dombek has a dry personality but if you spend just a minimum amount of time you will see there is a warm and concerned individual beneath it The man knows his trade very well but if a condition needs expertise he is humble enough to know and admit it I've had a # of conditions that scores of other drs have scratched their heads at  In most of those Dr Dombek has correctly diagnosed them from routine examinations and lab work The man is VERY smart and able ,4,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rani-alexander-2bwv8, Rani Alexander ,I went to Dr Alexander as a new patient after my primary care physician retired and had the least thorough examination of my life I stuck with her because the office is close to my home I am prescribed a controlled substance and was told most people develop coping mechanisms by now  instead of being walked through treatment alternatives I was billed close to $400  after insurance  for a physical and one medication visit  required by Dr every 4 months  I would not recommend to anyone ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rani-alexander-2bwv8, Rani Alexander ,I have ADD and take stimulants but have managed my medication well for several years always ending up with extras left at the end of each month because I'm consciously trying to avoid building a tolerance or becoming dependent but as soon as she found out she began treating me like I was a crackhead She flat out accused me of abusing my medication on my FIRST visit to her was extremely insulting and ignored everything else I said  the real concerns I went to her for were unaddressed ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rani-alexander-2bwv8, Rani Alexander ,She doesn't care about you They are a money making machine Getting as many patients in and out per day as possible My sister with Memory Loss Issues went in for her physical and Dr Alexander didn't even acknowledge that she was struggling to answer the Doctor's questions When I went to see her for extreme headaches she yawned through my entire appt and seemed totally bored through out my 10 min appt The staff seems bored as well No smiles  just attitude ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-jocelyn-duffy-3c2hs, Jocelyn Duffy ,Each time I have gone there I have been more disappointed I went to her with an emergency and needed a referral to a specialist She then gave me a referral to a place that did not accept my insurance The last time I went there she rushed through the appointment didn't listen to me and walked out of the room without finishing up with me When I went to the front desk to see if she was finished with me the receptionist laughed and said yes she's done  She has ZERO bedside manner ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-nancy-berube-x4d7g, Nancy Berube ,Yes sometimes I wait but that is because when it is my turn the providers spend time really listening finding out about me and explaining things whatever time it takes rather than just rushing me along to stay on a schedule For urgent things in and out right away ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-yuko-mccolgan-237hn, Yuko McColgan ,Did not find her very attentive or knowledgeable Would not recommend her I switched to Tufts which has been great Paid for blood tests but did not receive a copy of the results despite multiple requests but received multiple bills for it Also no follow up on the test results ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-linda-hindle-ycyms, Linda Hindle ,Doctor Hindle treats you like a business account rather than a patient She does not advocate for her patient but rather herself ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-linda-hindle-ycyms, Linda Hindle ,Came to this practice looking for a local and personalized approach to primary care but she is very impersonal Kind of awkward to share a room with Doesn't seem like she knows how to empathize well Didn't read my record before appointment for chronic health concern She says she has an on call provider but it goes to her cell when you call that number and she describes her practice as we  Very bizarre Wouldn't be surprised if the good reviews were written by herself ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-linda-hindle-ycyms, Linda Hindle ,Dr Hindle is kind and listens to her patients She will work with you to find solutions to problems and definitely gives a personal touch to the care she provides I feel I get very good care from her ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-james-fitzgerald-xsd2t, James Fitzgerald ,Dr James Fitzgerald is the worst doctor ever My employment changed carriers I needed all my scrips transferred to a new mail order for scrips I completed most of the information on the form All he had to do was fill out a small section his responsibility Hand delivered it to his office After several weeks I still hadn't received any meds When I called to inquire about them the nurse told me it was still sitting on his desk Need more space just the beginning of my ordeal All Lies ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-scott-lauermann-27n9b, Scott Lauermann ,Dr Louerman is not concerned about the quality of life you live he is just there for a paycheck When a Dr tells a person that he is FRUSTRATED with you cause you were diagnosed with an almeant that is life long and I could not remember the vascular surgeons name that he referred me to he is lazy all the info he needed was in my file He also stats I have 20 mins per patience and cuts your appointment short cause he was late and walked out of the room Not caring,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elena-smagina-34ng4, Elena Smagina ,I spent years going to the same Dr who brushed off ongoing symptoms I had as normal My first meeting with Dr Smagina she was concerned and immediately set up testing ultimately diagnosing me with a hormonal syndrome which has explained and fixed many health concerns She is incredibly thorough and I always leave feeling like all of my questions have been answered or she is working on answering them I moved almost an hour away and still drive to Medway because I trust her completely ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,I saw Dr Kogan from 2014 2018 She is in many regards lovely and a good primary care physician However recently I switched to a new doctor who informed me that my medical record stated I had issues with anxiety This was news to me because I have never had any mental health issues and no mental health professional has ever given me a diagnosis or spotted any symptoms This erroneous opinion should not be in my files especially since it was made without the guidance of a mental health professional and without my knowledge I was a minor at the time and my parents were also not made aware that Dr Kogan held this opinion I wish Dr Kogan the best but I hope that in the future she does not assume that stressing about midterms is equivalent to a very serious mental health challenge ,3,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,Dr Kogan is wonderful  but the medical staff and office staff are the worst I have ever dealt with ,3,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,It's very strange that some people rating this doctor by her billing department performance My advise call your insurance first and make sure that your plan is covering your doctors visits She is an excellent physician and a wonderful person Always helpful and knowledgeable I have to wait sometimes but she never rushed me out of the room if it takes 20 30 min instead of 15  she will dedicate it to discuss my problems ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,I have been a patient of Dr Kogan for many years  she has excellent bedside manners super nice very attentive and very helpful with referring to specialists The office staff can be friendlier in general but I personally never had any issues ,4,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,Go elsewhere On several occasions I have waited weeks for important lab results to be returned to me  more than once I was forced to cry on the phone in order to speak with an actual nurse or doctor Awful bedside manner  does not seem to care whatsoever about patients' pain or discomfort Office staff are rude disorganized and completely unhelpful Do yourself a favor and don't even think of going to this doctor ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,Dr Kogan has the best bed side manner and is very proactive with her approaches Issues with her practice is more the office Aside from Yana the staff is ever changing and some are not friendly/professional Getting an appointment is often difficult and the wait time is often 30 mins The online patient portal is iffy I stay for the great care from Dr Kogan though her office needs some work ,3,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-irina-kogan-2dbrd, Irina Kogan ,She was not great with proving adequate information and her office & staff were horrible I switched providers as soon as I could I would NEVER recommend her or her office to anyone not even my worst enemy ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-wheeler-2h9j9, John Wheeler ,it is too bad this physician is on this office I would not recommend Derry Medical Center to anyone Working in the health field I am positive they are not very knowledgeable to patient experience or the billing aspect It is a shame his talents are wasted in a facility that allows the front end  your first impression  to be rude unknowledgeable demeaning and uncooperative towards patients Think twice before making a appointment here ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-wheeler-2h9j9, John Wheeler ,He is an amazing dr He will always spend as much time with me as needed to help with my problem that I'm having ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristen-dimarco-xs389, Kristen Dimarco ,Above and beyond at every visit  I have recommended her to several very happy new patients She listens thinks and responds Which seems like what every doctor should do but so many are so rushed that it's not a given You will receive excellent care ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristen-dimarco-xs389, Kristen Dimarco ,There are only 2 words to describe Dr DiMarco The Best  ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristen-dimarco-xs389, Kristen Dimarco ,I arrived 15 minutes early for my scheduled appointment  an appointment made over a month in advance  to afford myself time to complete the prerequisite admin I presented identification and proof of insurance and patiently waited to be seen  for over 45 minutes In the end I simply could not wait any longer and was forced to return to work no explanation was ever offered The waiting room was very dark far to dark to comfortably read overall I felt ignored ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristen-dimarco-xs389, Kristen Dimarco ,I have been a patient with Dr Dimarco for many years and have recommended her to friends with the utmost confidence ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elisabeth-bassler-ybgkg, Elisabeth Bassler ,This was a new doctor for us I made an appointment months in advance for my kids' annual physical Two days before she canceled and they couldn't schedule us in with her in time for my kids to get their proof of physical checkups into the schools  which are required for many kids sports activities  Flash forward one month and my daughter needed to see a doctor for severe back pain Again couldn't get in to see Dr Bassler and the nurse practitioner was booked out too Awfully rude front office staff Asks no questions offers no options When I asked her to provide me options or suggestions  she belts out at me What do you want me to do I looked around the schedule for you If she's not available she's not available  They just don't care I will be leaving this practice before we even meet the doctor ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elisabeth-bassler-ybgkg, Elisabeth Bassler ,I brought my mother to her appointment in time Unfortunately theDr Bassler is not on time My mother was in the room for over two hours  No one ever said sorry for the wait she's running late nothing I had to ask several times what is going in She's either very thorough or totally incompetent My thought is incompetence,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elisabeth-bassler-ybgkg, Elisabeth Bassler ,I was with Dr Bassler for 10+ years I was fond of her at the beginning but over the years grew to feel that being her patient was an inconvenience for her and her practice Appointments required at least 6 months notice of which they'll cancel on you with little notice The attitude of the office was pretty hostile My RX was held hostage before with the office denying refills on a maintenance medication because my yearly appointment was cancelled  BY HER It's a circus ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elisabeth-bassler-ybgkg, Elisabeth Bassler ,Not only was I warned in a formal letter about missing an appointment I canceled timely with Elizabeth Bassler's N P I waited months to even get an appointment with Elizabeth Bassler They then went and cancelled my 2 successive appointments twice in two weeks with less than 24 hours notice and once when I was en route to the practice She talks down to disabled people as if they don't understand English and my test results which did need to be discussed were not timely given ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elisabeth-bassler-ybgkg, Elisabeth Bassler ,Our family has been seeing Doctor Bassler for nearly 16 years She is a compassionate listener who has helped us through some very trying times I appreciate her direct approach and the fact that she is hesitant to simple prescribe medications to cure every illness or symptom we bring to her Her approach as we have seen is conservative and through the years it has served us very well ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-elisabeth-bassler-ybgkg, Elisabeth Bassler ,Dr Bassler is an incompetent physician She is a very poor listener and therefore does not make accurate diagnoses She is on her schedule regardless of the seriousness of the patient's illness For me that resulted in a major and life threatening emergency surgery that would not have been necessary if she had paid attention to what I was telling her STAY AWAY ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-barbara-jablow-y6brh, Barbara Jablow ,Always excellent,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,Can no longer recommend him He was great before he joined Chartercare Now you can't get an appointment and my messages are not given to him I agree with the other reviewers: the staff is rude and unprofessional He always seems rushed now Sadly after decades of his great care I won't be returning to him ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,Hate to say it but I agree with the other reviewers on this site that since the office changed over to Charter Care the overall feel for this practice is negative My family has used Dr Horan as our family doctor for over 23 years and the rudeness of his new staff and the inability to get an appointment are beyond disappointing We'll be looking to find another practice We have good insurance  Blue Cross  so it's their loss not ours ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,Dr Horan has been our family Doctor for years He is very understanding and listens to every word you say He is not like some Doctors that you see that doesn't listen to you and pushes you out the door He has made me laugh and I as well make him laugh I would never change Doctors unless I moved out of the state and too far away to see him If you need a Doctor who listens as well as taking his time to take the best care of you Dr John Horan is your Doctor He is mine and I Love Him ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,Since Dr Horan has joined Chartercare scheduling a sick patient visit is impossibe I've been a a patient of Dr Horan for over 25 years The new office policy is that a patient must call at 8:30 and if they are one of two patients who call first they are given an appointment with the Doctor Twice I tried to call for an appointment and twice I was told by the office staff to go to an Urgent Care Center This resulted in a loss of continuity of my care as well as an increase in cost to me ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,I have been a patient with Dr Horan and previously Dr Fallon for 27 years I haven't been to the doctor since 2011  I haven't been sick at all but mainly because I didn't have health insurance I now have health insurance called recently for an appointment wasn't feeling very good  Office staff is horrible actually booked me an appointment in November and said since I hadn't been in the office I am now going to have to be a new patient  27 years doesn't mean anything ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,Dr Horan is progressive and leaves no stone unturned Love this dr ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-horan-xt56n, John Horan ,Great doctor awful staff Office jokes inappropriate customer service not so good hung up on talked to with disrespect Instead of apologizing we were called liars Very doubtful that a patient with fabricate a disrespectful office joke by an office manage ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mario-dominguez-23gch, Mario Dominguez ,I would recommend that you do a self diagnosis first before you even think about going to this so called doctor It is hard to believe that his license has not be revoked by the state by now He never read any of my lab work for two years which resulted in serious health issues for me I went thru hell because of him and neither the office or he ever called to see how I was doing ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mario-dominguez-23gch, Mario Dominguez ,The doctor wouldn't even discuss with me reasons wouldn't sign some temporary disability forms  In his words  I will discuss that with you even knowing I was having serious Back surgery,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mario-dominguez-23gch, Mario Dominguez ,I see a lot of reviews that do not like how quick he is or does not take the time to explain things I prefer a doctor who is quick Any questions I had I asked and received a detailed answer I also prefer not to have a long drawn out conversation I just want the facts I do not need my Dr to shoot the breeze with me ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mario-dominguez-23gch, Mario Dominguez ,Dr Dominguez never spoke directly to my son with developmental disabilities  25yrs old  During a physical he never had him leave his wheelchair He speaks so fast even I had a hard time following him Terrible ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mario-dominguez-23gch, Mario Dominguez ,Worst Doctor Ive seen in my 31 years on this earth VERY quick to write u and ur concerns off He cancels appointments within hours of their scheduled time if he thinks your reason for seeing him that day is all in your head and does not take your health concerns seriously at all He doesn't care about your health history and even poked my stomach and told me to lose weight and all my health issues would disappear If u need to spend more than 5 mins with ur dr Avoid this one at all costs ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-subroto-bhattacharya-xgxgd, Subroto Bhattacharya ,TL DR  TL DR: Bhattacharya only wants multiple visits to charge your insurance company You're just a paycheck to him He'll only refer you to his closest friends and unless you argue will only give out those names on the referrals requiring you to schedule another appointment to get another referral Too aggressive no emotional attachment or sympathetic towards his patients Also  glad I recorded a few of my visits The last one with my medical proxy was especially interesting ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-murray-norcross-xb54f, Murray Norcross ,Dr Norcross is the best He is thorough caring engaging and informative Unfortunately he is no longer at South coast and they have provided no explanation They are a disaster My medical file was replaced by another patient with my name and it took weeks to resolve Not responding to rest of questions because they are horrible as it related to south coast and nothing to do with Dr Norcross ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-murray-norcross-xb54f, Murray Norcross ,Best Doctor I've ever had Listens to you and doesn't spin you around and shuffle you out the door Explains all problems in detail and explained all meds and how they work I really felt he cared about my health I've been to many doctors and he was the best ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-murray-norcross-xb54f, Murray Norcross ,He is condescending and makes decisions about the patient's health without all of the facts He makes his diagnoses before even seeing the patient or reviewing the pertinent information His own issues interfere with his making accurate medically based patient care decisions ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-silvia-los-2gqfy, Silvia Los ,Our experience with Dr Los was horrible She had no knowledge of men's health issues and referred us to expensive specialists for things she could have easily managed herself She also failed to inform me of serious problems in my blood tests which I didn't discover until I changed to a new doctor In addition the office staff were rude and ineffective not returning calls as promised and telling me to just go to urgent care or the ER for my problems Worst doctor I have ever seen ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-silvia-los-2gqfy, Silvia Los ,Approachable doctor who I felt very comfortable with She has a professional but kind approach Am glad to find this doctor and has easy access ,4,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-silvia-los-2gqfy, Silvia Los ,Dr Los seems uninterested in patients and not very knowledgeable about conditions I don't have a lot of confidence in her patient assessment or treatment ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-silvia-los-2gqfy, Silvia Los ,The Dr just kind of breezed in had little interest in what I had to say or in my concerns that I'm taking too many prescriptions I'm fighting with the devil to get a referral out of her office ease of location and her willingness to take Mass Health is not enough to make me want to see her again I'll gladly wait forever to see a Dr that may or may not care ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-patricia-labaire-2ll4w, Patricia Labaire ,I've been seeing Dr Labaire since she started practicing in Plymouth about six years ago and find her to be a fine physician She always takes time and care to review my health concerns and test results with me and has made several referrals to specialists when I have had issues that required it I find her to be a straight shooter who provides me with all of the information I need to have to make informed medical decisions I'd recommend Dr Labaire to anyone looking for an experienced and skilled diagnostician ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-patricia-labaire-2ll4w, Patricia Labaire ,I am so disappointed in this doctor I recently had surgery for endometriosis and my surgeon referred me to a pain clinic however my insurance informed me it needs to be from a primary care which I didn't have I decided to find one in the area and went to Patricia She could have cared less about anything I had to say and told me I should get tested for celiac I told her I already have a diagnosis for endometriosis and I needed a referral She told me I didn't need pain medication and denied,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-patricia-labaire-2ll4w, Patricia Labaire ,I'm very disappointed    I gave her time  6 years  and was thinking maybe I have very high standards but not  Her is one of the weakest doctors I ever met She does nothing to find out the cause of the problems she doesn't care and doesn't dig deep and a patient has to die in order her start doing something    very disappointed I lost so much time with her  A Bad at diagnostics or treating anything but the sniffles However she will refer to specialists Office is quiet easy to get appoin,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-patricia-labaire-2ll4w, Patricia Labaire ,I am so happy and grateful my mom and I found Dr Patricia Labaire for our primary care physician She is an extremely knowledgeable physician with a calm non alarmist approach to medicine which puts her patients at ease Dr Labaire identified and addressed a potentially serious condition in my mom recommending treatment before it became a high risk situation It is such a great feeling to know you and your loved ones are being cared for by the best We highly recommend Dr Labaire ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-patricia-labaire-2ll4w, Patricia Labaire ,Dr Patricia LaBaire has sincere concern for her patient's well being She was specific when questioning me about my health history After my having 3 difficult bouts of diverticulitis she diagnosed my condition to be serious enough to see a colorectal surgeon My seeing the surgeon saved me from a potentially dangerous condition Thank you Dr LaBaire you are an amazing Primary Care Specialist  I am fortunate to have you Mary L Martikke,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-patricia-labaire-2ll4w, Patricia Labaire ,I don't have faith in too many doctors but Dr Labaire has done good by me where others have let me slip through the cracks I'm not one to ever run to the ER or hospital but I know if I have to she's there  I highly recommend her if you're looking for quality care she's the one ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mark-ringiewicz-xcn7v, Mark Ringiewicz ,Although a nice guy my issue is with him canceling appts My parter had his annual physical rescheduled twice resulting in a 6 month delay and now this summer mine got postponed by him and now I have to wait 4 months It wouldn't be so bad if rescheduling took only a few weeks but that is definitely not the case Also sick visits must be scheduled the morning of  they won't book you for the next day if they have no slots that day You have to call every am ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mark-ringiewicz-xcn7v, Mark Ringiewicz ,Thank you Dr Ringiewicz you are awesome ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-keith-callahan-2tvhh, Keith Callahan ,very happy with my Dr ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-keith-callahan-2tvhh, Keith Callahan ,After 20+ years with another primary care provider who's practice became too busy  I recently switched to Dr Callahan The experience has been remarkable with the ease of making appointments to a thorough exam and the appropriate time spent discussing treatment options Dr Callahan is an excellent primary care physician,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-keith-callahan-2tvhh, Keith Callahan ,Dr Callahan has been my primary since 2008 He was recommended to me by another doctor who was not taking any more patients The most I've had to wait is 20 min but I usually arrive a little early They have been very accomodating when I need to cancel or reschedule I prefer a doctor who actually looks into why you may need something and schedules the appropriate tests instead of just prescribing a prescription Dr Callahan is very professional and through in this way ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-keith-callahan-2tvhh, Keith Callahan ,Considerable wait for DR  an hour later than my appointment time The worst part was the HORRIBLE rude receptionist My husband needed to use the restroom and had to get the key from her She was talking to her daughter or friend or something and ignored him at the window for almost 5 minutes She said that she loved the other lady who she was talking to which is why I assumed that she was a relation Incredibly rude and disrespectful of customers I won't go back ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-keith-callahan-2tvhh, Keith Callahan ,New patient 2 routine visits both wait times over an hour and tried for a 3rd sick visit 1 week  went to walk in  Provider and staff are very nice Dr will give you the time you need and not rush you However scheduling management is poor Question whether they have more patients then they can accommodate ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-lydia-bennett-2q7b4, Lydia Bennett ,I have been a patient of Dr Bennett's for over 10 years and feel strongly that she has given me excellent care through serious medical issues and the every day little things  She welcomes me warmly by name remembers my medical issues and never seems to be in a hurry When I had been quite sick she insisted on frequent follow up When I ask questions about whether a test or drug is really necessary she is more than willing to listen to my concerns and questions ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-lydia-bennett-2q7b4, Lydia Bennett ,Dr Bennett provides care to each member of my family and I couldn't be more pleased She's always been available to answer any questions I have had in relation to my young daughters whether it be through the medical email system or by return phone call She remembers key things about my children's medical history and always takes my concerns seriously I am surprised to see some negative reviews here so I wanted to be sure to provide my overwhelmingly positive experience ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-lydia-bennett-2q7b4, Lydia Bennett ,I would not recommend this provider She has no bedside manner her personality is extremely dry and I feel she provided very generic care No follow up after a significant occurrence and my request for a pertinent lab add on was not even acknowledged nor addressed by her after contacting the office which I find extremely rude and unprofessional A courtesy return call from the nurse explaining provider rationale for not wanting to add lab on would have been a basic minimum standard of care ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-lydia-bennett-2q7b4, Lydia Bennett ,It is impossible to get a hold of the doctor when you have an issue or question I had a reaction to a medication and it took three days for her to finally get back to me and that was after I called 5 6 times every day On top of that she gave me incorrect information about an illness I had She told me it couldn't be passed from one person to another which it turns out is incorrect I got much more accurate information from my fiancees doctor when he was diagnosed with the same issue ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-david-cunningham-3hvj6, David Cunningham ,Dr Cunningham is the best Very easy to talk to takes his time to answer all questions and most importantly is a great doctor whom is always keeping up with the medical industry I cannot recommend him enough Also his staff is great ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-david-cunningham-3hvj6, David Cunningham ,Hands down the finest most competent physician I've met in my 52 yrs Extremely knowledgeable and compassionate Since he left Compass I have been lost searching for a comparable physician David actually found an unknown serious heart condition via a very basic EKG and likely saved my life Every cardiologist that hears how I found out about My diagnosis praises David as extremely bright and informed ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-david-cunningham-3hvj6, David Cunningham ,First let me Thank Dr David Cunningham and his staff for always being so kind My mom has been his patient for 14 years My mom is disabled I've had to get involved with her care Not only has Dr Cunningham welcomed me but he always tells me what a wonderful job I am doing with my mom and her care We have followed him to every practice he has ever moved to Most importantly mom loves him and we are Very grateful to have him Dr Cunningham you are one of a kind ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-david-cunningham-3hvj6, David Cunningham ,Excellent doctor Seriously listens to you is very kind and caring great bedside manner also very open minded and willing to explore all options with you and while not a holistic doctor or naturopath at all he was very kind to me and respected my desires to use a natural approach when possible  but he will tell you when you DO need meds   I would still be seeing him if I did not have to move 2 hours away I actually stayed and made the drive for a while but that's no longer logical for me ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristina-jackson-yhr4q, Kristina Jackson ,She was wonderful,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristina-jackson-yhr4q, Kristina Jackson ,2015 Office staff are horrible High Turn over rate Poor record keeping or file updates little to no call backs referrals are not done in a timely manner Practice shares office space with Orthopedic Practice I won't even see my orthopedic at this location even though it's closer to home just to avoid being exposed to the horribleness of the office staff due to its proximity Yes it's really that bad the Dr takes no steps to improve it Many other Drs have left this joint practice,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-jonathan-snider-33m87, Jonathan Snider ,Dr Snider is a tremendous physician Ample time spent during appointments Communicates very well Very current on medications and medical treatments Very pleasant and genuinely interested in patient input A+ every day ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-jeremiah-frank-xjqjl, Jeremiah Frank ,Very good Dr I am now 50 and have been going there since I was born Have been seen by all the Drs Who have owned this practice and have always been happy Dr Frank took over this practice from Dr Greene The scheduling has been interesting in the past to get a appointment but I will say lately they try there best under busy circumstances to get you in to be seen They always alert the Dr To what issue you are having and always have some sort of communication back to you from the Dr ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-jeremiah-frank-xjqjl, Jeremiah Frank ,Dr Frank is a positive and direct person who I believe really cares about his patients and wants the best for them I trust him and would recommend anyone to his practice I have found the office staff to be friendly and helpful and have never had a negative experience with anyone at the office ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-jeremiah-frank-xjqjl, Jeremiah Frank ,When I'm in the office with Dr Frank he's very attentive and helpful However scheduling an office visit even when very sick is difficult I can't count the number of times when I have been sick requested an appointment and was told that I couldn't be seen until the next day or days Shouldn't the sick patient take priority Other staff:  RECEPTIONIST is bitter and not very helpful  ever  I often feel as if I am being scolded for calling  NURSE PRACTITIONER = excellent ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sharon-mullane-2cs3x, Sharon Mullane ,I pulled all 3 of my kids from this practice after having them 'discharge' my self pay son over a small balance I have always pre paid and over paid for appts so that I wouldn't carry over a balance for my son recently I became certain that I have an underlying disease that needs to be diagnosed so I made an appt for myself They discharged me over a $135 claim that the billers sent to my old policy Absolutely unreal 20+ years at this practice and this is what it's come to ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-cherylyn-black-yl9t4, Cherylyn Black ,I have been a patient of Dr Black's for about 10 years I have always felt she has given me all the time I have ever needed and I have never felt uncomfortable speaking about any topic with her She always gives me the time that I need and fits me in whenever possible if short notice I would definitely recommend this practice since they moved to a larger facility they have more specialties to cover everything in one stop  Along with a lab and X ray on site and extended hours ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-cherylyn-black-yl9t4, Cherylyn Black ,Saw her for several years and was disappointed as the practice seemed to get less effective over time She ordered incorrect tests and incorrect referrals or delegated to assistants who did so This all led to degraded confidence and caused me to seek a new doctor ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-cherylyn-black-yl9t4, Cherylyn Black ,Dr Black is great her staff needs help I had some test done and after the results came in I got a call with the diagnosis basic introduction of who is calling and from where and why took all of 1 minute and 16 seconds which left me wondering what to do so I am now having to see a some one else since they did not tell me what to do or what is next ,4,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-cherylyn-black-yl9t4, Cherylyn Black ,I am very happy with Dr Black and Dr Fritz I have never seen Dr Connolly Dr Black has the perfect balance of listening to your health problems and at the same time keeping things moving so other patients get in and out quickly Dr Black is very personable as well She takes any concerns seriously and will recommend a specialist if necessary Her front desk efficiently and quickly processes any follow on appointments Doctors she has referred have also been very good A+++ to the office ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-cherylyn-black-yl9t4, Cherylyn Black ,Have had her for many years She is thorough and really listens I have a major depressive disorder and some doctors quickly tell u it is just anxiety Dr black never does Her partners dr Lisa Connolly md and Douglas fritz md are exceptional as well Good practice ,4,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-daniel-mccullough-y2tkd, Daniel McCullough ,Our whole family sees Dr McCullough and trust him immensely He has gone above and beyond and always feel confident with his approach for any medical concerns we've encountered Highly recommended,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-daniel-mccullough-y2tkd, Daniel McCullough ,Dr McCullough used to care I believe he is bogged down with insurance and boredom in his job He cares little about his patients and making sure that they are properly taken care of If a complaint or concern is brought to his attention: he brushes it off and blames it on the nurses Medication is wrong mistakes are not fixed attention is missing I could go on and on The problems with him are his fault The problems with his practice starts at the top  he is at the top Don't go McCullough,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-daniel-mccullough-y2tkd, Daniel McCullough ,Dr McCullough has been my physician for about eight years now and I think he's great He's personable and caring and though the work ups are complete he doesn't rush to prescribe drugs or procedures but very clearly outlines a patient centered approach to issues He bothers to take the time to talk and get to the bottom of things He even has a good sense of humor I've had a couple of billing issues but that's the office  or my insurance   not the Drs fault ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-prathima-chaloori-yns4p, Prathima Chaloori ,I saw Dr Chaloori for about 5 years I was complaining of headaches each year and she told me I had allergies and to take allergy medication I went this year for a sick visit because my headaches had turned into migranes She told me I was paranoid and had allergies and had to listen to her She stated that my headaches havent gone away because I did not take the allergy medicine year round I insisted on allergy testing to find out what I am allergic to and I have no allergies ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-timothy-tierney-y9rgj, Timothy Tierney ,Not a hands on Dr He Reminds me More of a Lazy Traffic Cop in the sense of directing your problems elsewhere away from his responsibility and into the abyss as long as He accepts your insurance before your sent into the lost cause lane That and Pharmaceuticals don't cure everything I ended up with a Super Bug due to an over prescribed Antibiotic instead of actually Finding out as why I was getting sick  Avoid this Guy like the Plague ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,I was assigned to this Dr when mine left the Practice This Dr seemed to go out of my way to make my life very difficult No follow up doesn't listen doesn't return calls doesn't call in prescriptions when she says she will Left her and got a new Primary Care Physician  Do NOT SIGN ON WITH THIS DOCTOR ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,She does not listen to patients concerns at all When I saw her she completely ignored what I was saying and changed the subject to something she felt was more important to discuss I've been seeing her since she started with Signature Healthcare and her general disregard for patients has become an increasing problem over the years Additionally after being her patient for a few years even with her computer in front of her she has no idea what my name is ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,I have had alot of primary care doctors They always seem to leave signature healthcare Dr Tagoe has by far been the best Always listens to my concerns and addresses them Very laid back doctor doesn't make you feel insignificant Also your always seeing her Not her NP or someone else She is always there for the appt Receptionist is awesome too Very helpful and caring ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,The dr shows lack of urgency to serious medical complications which have led to the hospitalizations Misplaces or ignore paperwork quite a bit and is a huge pain to get a hold of concerning anything of importance Highly incompetent to the point of negligence ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,New patients beware If I could rate this doctor for zero stars I would  This doctor completely lacks compassion and only care about billing your insurances company for appts that you do not need because she is to lazy to look into your medical history  She does not return phone calls infact actually embarrasses you in front of her staff by having you leave a hundred messages reguarding any issues you may have so the whole office knows your business  Should not be practicing medicine at all,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,I got stuck with her as my Primary care doctor My first appointment with her was a sick visit she tested me for the flu it came back negative but as far as that she could not come in contact with me or tell me anything She asked nothing health related and also seemed very uncaring and unwilling to answer any questions My symptoms are awful and Dr Rachel Tagoe has nothing to say as far as a follow up or telling me what I have ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,I saw this Dr A few weeks ago She seems very sweet and caring She was able to answer my questions that my previous doctor could not explain in a way I understood This was only a brief meeting but so far I'm happy After reading the reviews I almost canceled but I'm glad I didn't I know it's tough finding a good one The Receptionist was very helpful In my scheduling needs ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-rachel-tagoe-gf6lh, Rachel Tagoe ,My doctor left signature health and I was left with her She never spoke to me or asked any health related questions Just took me off my existing medications without care and laughed with her receptionist when I left the office in tears If you are looking for a new primary care I would stay clear of this doctor ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-achilles-romualdo-alcaraz-3n42n, Achilles Romualdo Alcaraz ,While I actually found Dr Alcaraz quite wonderful as a human I met him once to see if I could be on board with him as a new PCP for me He could have been a good doctor but I will never know The Medical group itself is horrible I worked hard to ensure records for my complex medical needs were sent there as well as filling out their forms in advance and mailing them They had nothing I waited 48 mins to see the doctor to find out they knew nothing about me Then spent 10 minutes with him before he left And even though it is steward the same network as my former PCP I had to sign onto my own personal patient portal on my phone to give them info etc Then was offered a vaccine they didn't have So all and all I won't be returning there and Hawthorn medical group is really only for people who are ok being treated like a number not an individual I was very disappointed ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-achilles-romualdo-alcaraz-3n42n, Achilles Romualdo Alcaraz ,You always seem rushed and he's not the easiest guy to talk to I attribute much of this to the Stewart/Hawthorn Medical which is a bit of a factory Lots of tests done all of the time and you have to circle back and make sure you get the results because often you will not get a call Then you have a secretary trying to interpret your lab results Moved to another practice after a year I experienced the same kind of service from the other specialists at Stewart/Hawthorn ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-debra-roberts-3l8xb, Debra Roberts ,Dr Robert is amazing She provides excellent compassionate care for my entire family She isn't just treating one of us she treats the family Her staff is great ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-nicole-wood-ysk4s, Nicole Wood ,Dr Wood offers exceptionally poor follow up and non existent call back to patients My wife experienced a sudden and very painful medical condition Dr Wood was baffled as to what the issue was ordered blood tests which came back over 48 hours ago After 3 phone calls into Dr Wood asking for a report and desperately requesting medication to ease pain we have not heard a word from Dr Wood  who is apparently too busy to call us I would not recommend her to anyone ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-linnea-meyer-y9fpb, Linnea Meyer ,I can't recommend Dr Meyer enough She is incredibly detailed and thorough  my first appointment with her lasted a full two hours in order to go over my complete medical history She offers a unique balance of the practicality of Western medicine combined with the wholistic approach of Eastern medicine which I really appreciated  in the past I've felt that doctors tended to throw medicine at a problem instead of figuring out why the problem was occurring This was happily not the case with Dr Meyer :  Being able to communicate with her through a secure messaging app is a big bonus since not every question is urgent enough to need a full appointment However I know that Dr Meyer would happily see me at any time  you can tell she really cares about her patients I had a health scare during pregnancy and she patiently answered my frantic after hours call to figure out what was going on In the end it turned out everything was fine but I really appreciated how she handled the s,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-andrew-lenhardt-yk859, Andrew Lenhardt ,It is nice to know that someone in the area cares about those with the difficult conditions Unfortunately Dr Linhardt is not accepting new patients despite the websites stating otherwise However he is very willing to take $250 cash to suggest treatment plans I would think that doctors in the area were already collaborating about treatment of difficult conditions It pains my heart to think of someone taking advantage of the most desperate and vulnerable patients for profit ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-surender-singh-2hh89, Surender Singh ,At first Dr Singh seemed very attentive taking copious note as I described my problems It became apparent that he was not really listening as his prescriptions were for symptoms and not causes He kept prescribing Prozac for osteoarthritis overactive bladder and hemorrhoids He also prescribed a sleeping drug  Trazodone  because my overactive bladder kept waking me up at night My current physician has prescribed appropriate medication and treatments for my problems and they have worked ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-surender-singh-2hh89, Surender Singh ,Unprofessional secretary  Doctor Leaves door open when in an appointment with you and takes phone calls Bills you for things that he never did Gets offended if you want a referral to see a specialist  really unprofessional  Office is dirty  Pushes medications instead of sending you for a mri etc,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-surender-singh-2hh89, Surender Singh ,I do not recommend this doctor to anyone My husband was in the hospital 2 days after visiting with this doctor I figured we would give him a chance but I firmly believe he has no bedside manner whatsoever We are very disappointed especially when Dr Singh said he could not manage my husbands condition over the phone and make an appointment  Very insulted that he hung up on my husband It's no wonder we could get the appointment right away Clearly he does not have many patients ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-surender-singh-2hh89, Surender Singh ,Very attentive to our family needs,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kenneth-fowler-yjcdp, Kenneth Fowler ,If I could give no stars I would Absolutely terrible communication skills Extremely rude staff Was irritated that I kept calling when NO ONE was returning my phone calls or submitting a PA when I requested Don't waste your time ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kenneth-fowler-yjcdp, Kenneth Fowler ,He is quick to give you prescription drugs he isn't equipped to give out and send you to specialists without researching if the specialist treats the condition He is good for colds but for major health issues he is not very good Primary Care because he is overbooked and overworked he can not find the time to help his patients ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-watson-xx883, John Watson,Incorrigible I was referred from Boston after a diagnosis of Psorasis as they have UVB Treatment that is closer to home Otherwise I would have stayed in Boston Dr Watson didn't answer any of my questions spoke over me and suggested I look things up on the internet versus providing any recommendations for diet etc He lacked empathy and continually redirected questions DDon'twaste your time ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-andrea-bond-yw6mp, Andrea Bond ,Professional but I question her practices Long story short  I developed a higher blood pressure  she informed me it was borderline hypertension and I need to get my diet in order  I actually eat relatively healthy  or I'd have to go on BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION I'm 25 and on birth control I think there's a smarter answer than giving me a drug  I also get refills without required follow up appointments It seems like my health isn't important and that I'm just $$$ to this company ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-manuela-mendes-ywp7c, Manuela Mendes ,Dr Mendes used to good and caring but my last visit was very disapointing with myself being berated and told to be quiet that she didnt need to hear what i was going to say making very clear that i wasnt bright enough to be able to describe what i was going through And that was after she asked how i was doing,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-manuela-mendes-ywp7c, Manuela Mendes ,I've been going to Dr Mendes since she started out in pediatric care She invest her time to figure out what is wrong and diagnose accordingly ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-manuela-mendes-ywp7c, Manuela Mendes ,My experience with Dr Mendes used to be very good As a doctor I highly recommend her But due to some of her office personnel and office manager I am considering finding a new primary dr Their incompetence lack of respect and uncaring attitude is completely unacceptable So very sad that she is going to loose patients and has lost patients because of a few despicable office employees ,3,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-stacey-breen-greally-3cw5n, Stacey Breen Greally ,She does not listen She told me I had a blockage and needed to go to emergency The EKG was done wrong She ordered many expensive tests which proved there was nothing wrong with me She WANTED me to be sick and would not listen to when I said happen She caused me a lot of distress and expense ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-stephen-buchanan-yqvjb, Stephen Buchanan ,I have been going to Dr Buchanan for 10 years or so now  Don't pay any attention to the rediculous 1 star reviews he has He is the best doctor I have ever been to He is honest about everything and always takes time to listen If he isn't sure about a concern he will research it or send you to a specialist He has told me honestly that some meds work and some don't and it's all trial and error which is true He is attentive to my care and always follows up I would never go to anyone else and my whole family goes to him too Highly recommended,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-stephen-buchanan-yqvjb, Stephen Buchanan ,One of the worst doctors ever Most of his advice is close to useless & seems to be serving his and his clinic's interest in some way He gains from sickness and does not believe in prevention or being proactive A doctor who thinks premature greying of hair is normal does not consider recommended Vitamins/minerals  including Hb  to be important recommends unsolicited tests loves steroids is very dangerous I cancelled my partner's preventive check with him His smooth talk can fool you ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-galina-feldman-bssoz, Galina Feldman ,Anyone who does not like Dr Feldman  its most likely because she refused to prescribe them pain meds or benzos I have seen this myself while I was at her office one young girl who you can tell what she's up to  was hollaring and screaming that she did not get her prescription and that she was not going to be able to function without her meds VERY SAD ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-mark-selesnick-x2rbh, Mark Selesnick ,He doesn't listen He assumed because I am in chronic pain that I was some drug addict He changed my prescriptions because as he put it I'm not going to have some other doctor tell me what prescription's to give you I was on this non narcotic for five years I explained to him that I could not afford my diabetic insulin He did not care he was very cold Instead he said I needed to see a special This only cost me more money I had to pay a large co pay this did not help at all ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-khalil-alleyne-ggqp3, Khalil Alleyne ,My reason for the visit was to talk about some anxiety I have been having and that I was having a hard time since losing a loved one He was extremely uncaring and basically kept asking So why are you here and just so you know i won't be prescribing you any meds for this I never asked for any meds and was looking for some guidance I guess I went to the wrong place because my mental health is not his priority He is extremely arrogant and I left there feeling even more anxious than before,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-khalil-alleyne-ggqp3, Khalil Alleyne ,When I mentioned I wanted to start phasing off anxiety meds after 3 yrs of taking them his response was great then do it  I found it strange he did not ask why I wanted to phase off and also did not explain how I should phase off Instead he made it feel like he wanted to get to his next patient and showed no interest in an important decision Come to find out after I phased off over 2 weeks and symptoms returned I should have phased off slower a PA informed me Would not recommend ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-khalil-alleyne-ggqp3, Khalil Alleyne ,He misdiagnosed what ended up being a serious case of tonsillitis and when I asked him to prescribe something to swab on the back of my throat so I could swallow my own saliva he told me it looked like a virus wasn't that bad and he would not give me a narcotic I never asked for that I found him arrogant and a completely inept know it all I would never recommend him ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-khalil-alleyne-ggqp3, Khalil Alleyne ,He would often comment on how he did not have a lot of time in the vist I asked about a medical condition I had recently seen a PA at his office for he told me that he was not sure he had time to gett into that ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-khalil-alleyne-ggqp3, Khalil Alleyne ,Dr Alleyne made me feel so comfortable He was very compassionate and explained Everything he was doing I would highly recommend him ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tanvee-dhruva-xq6w9, Tanvee Dhruva ,Dr Dhruva seems like she does care but I seriously question her clinical judgement I saw her after not having a physical for years I was having serious left abdomen pain She kept bringing up diabetes and mumbling things like diabetic colitis under her breath I am overweight Clearly she just saw me as a fat person After I was told I'd wait two months for an ultrasound I decided to go to a UMass doctor As it happens I don't have diabetes and required surgery to remove a kidney stone ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tanvee-dhruva-xq6w9, Tanvee Dhruva ,I am stunned & discusted by some of the negative reviews here Terribly unfair and inappropriate Dr Dhruva has been exceptionally thorough in diagnosing and treating my often serious health issues through the years I've never been given the bums rush  even though I sometimes look like a bum   She has made time for me always and given me her FULL attention I might add that Dr Dhruva keeps impeccable health records on me  she always knows the right questions to ask and how to treat ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tanvee-dhruva-xq6w9, Tanvee Dhruva ,Very nice lady but quick with the pills Not for me I needed to get to the bottom of my medical issues not be thrown an RX for mental issues I do not have Regular physical exams probably fine but keep away if you want an actual resolution if you are ill Go with your gut ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tanvee-dhruva-xq6w9, Tanvee Dhruva ,She is by far the worst doctor I have ever experienced The visit itself was a horror show and she clearly has no idea what she is doing but worse than that she was supposed to refill a prescription for me and failed to do so After calling back twice she finally put the prescription through to which she prescribed 4 pills I should get a month supply as per every other doctor I have ever seen It has been a month and I have now called back 3 times and still do not have resolution ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-david-clark-y6tg5, David Clark ,Dr Clark was extremely rude unprofessional and completely brushed off my well documented medical issues as all in my head He even insisted that positive laboratory results for sleep apnea were not real sleep apnea and therefore there was no condition to treat and the findings clinically insignificant Dr Clark was not only unprofessional his refusal to treat me in an unbiased manner significantly jeopardized my health Flash forward several years later yes I always did have sleep apnea but it went untreated thanks in good part to this man's biased assessment of the results  he's not even a sleep doctor  I finally had a sleep apnea study done recently and YES I have sleep apnea with significant oxygen desaturation events And it turns out I had a serious autoimmune disease that went undiagnosed for many years Rather than helping me Dr Clark was more interested in psychoanalyzing me intent on finding psychiatric causes for my health problems Terrible doctor ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-steven-frank-y77p2, Steven Frank ,My family and I have been going to Dr Frank's office for years and for varying reasons we have all decided to move on My reasons are that even though I am charged for a full office visit I always feel rushed while I am there The office staff is friendly but the billing department makes a mistake in the coding EVERY time one of us goes to his office I really don't have the time to call my insurance company and then his office each time they submit their claim to the insurance company ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christopher-braga-2twgb, Christopher Braga ,He's just not a very good doctor I've seen him once in two years because he is literally always on vacation when I call to schedule appointments I always end up having appointments with his colleagues and never him That being said my concerns are never addressed by his office I have ended up getting x rays for things I didn't need x rays for and despite having a working knowledge of what medications have and haven't worked for me they refuse to listen to my concerns with meds ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-veronica-rusu-ycvh7, Veronica Rusu ,My feedback today is not about Dr Rusu it is about the nurses and the staff that work with her My wife has been her patient since a year or so Recently we got some bloodwork done and when we called after two days to check on the results the nurse was very rude and said  next time wait for a letter and you are not suppose to call us  In the past we have got many tests done but never have ever received any letters in the mail therefore we called Pathetic staff ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tara-nolan-ytlnf, Tara Nolan ,Great dr can diagnose a significant issue but only if you're the perfect perfect patient Prioritizes the next patient in line Requires a separate visit for each concern  multiple trips vs a further pcp who can handle everything in one annual exam  Argumentative and makes assumptions prescribing/encouraging medication such as vitamin d without a blood test without asking if maybe the patient consumes enough vitamin d naturally as dermatologists recommend all of which can result in misdiagnoses as well as side effects of unnecessary medicine It's important to have a pcp who you can feel comfortable opening up to medically and brainstorming and discussing your concerns not someone who you feel the need to hide medical concerns and be as quick and quiet as possible so as not to risk getting attitude We may be the patients but this dr needs more patience ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tara-nolan-ytlnf, Tara Nolan ,Dr Nolan is terrible Doesn't care and doesn't take time to understand basic issues and help her patients I am very disappointed with our decision to switch over and will be finding someone quickly Beware very poor ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tara-nolan-ytlnf, Tara Nolan ,Dr Nolan is very condescending and rude Does not take the time to understand the patient's condition Also there is no way to get in touch with her over the phone Nurse practitioner handles all calls and refuses to allow patient to talk to the doctor Very lousy practice ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tara-nolan-ytlnf, Tara Nolan ,Dr Nolan was condescending and rude As a new patient she tried to change my medication on the first visit without even reading my file She actually acted as if it was my fault that she hadn't read the file When I told her about concerns that my pervious doctor had she brushed them aside My second visit with Dr Nolan was cancelled for no reason When I told the office staff that I would not be rescheduling they didn't ask why I can not give one positive about visit with Dr Nolan ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-bernard-westerling-xw9v7, Bernard Westerling III ,Always fits patients with a need into his schedule Sometimes this means he runs late but it's worth it as each patient gets the necessary time and attention He also is fabulous as a PCP in terms of looking at specialists info explaining results in context of the big picture ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-bernard-westerling-xw9v7, Bernard Westerling III ,Dr Westerling is a decent doctor but the office staff is absolutely terrible They are rude and take forever to get back to you about any questions They are the reason why I stopped going to Dr Westerling ,3,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-bernard-westerling-xw9v7, Bernard Westerling III ,Dr Westerling was my childhood dr I came to see him for something in my 20's that is still unresolved He asked if I had insurance I told him no So he said he would only do a few tests Weeks later with no results I received a bill for $2 700 I had to request the results and called may times to talk with him to discuss those results and he never called back or showed any concern whatsoever for my well being There was so follow up no explaination no referrel and no suggestions ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-bernard-westerling-xw9v7, Bernard Westerling III ,Dr Westerling was my childhood doctor I always found him a bit cold/creepy When I went to college it touched off a major period of mismanagement of care that majorly derailed my life for the next several years including having to drop out of school due to health All of my supposed problems were due to overprescription of medications that his office was pushing at the time including being put on counter indicated drugs simultaneously Then i was pulled off everything cold turkey ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-macario-corpuz-xsrdf, Macario Corpuz Jr ,By far my favorite Dr In 15 years I've had many many Drs in 3 different states He listens and truly cares I am alive due to his hard work and diligence I whole heartily can not say enough he brightens my day every time I come in and his hard work never let's me down If your looking to not just be a name or number on a piece of paper then look no further He is the #1 Doctor on the east coast i m o you wont be disappointed ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-macario-corpuz-xsrdf, Macario Corpuz Jr ,Very poor bedside manner bordering on just plain rude ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-macario-corpuz-xsrdf, Macario Corpuz Jr ,Although I did not see this doctor personally he treated my grandfather He falsely diagnosed my grandfathers broken ribs as just bruises and sent him home When other problems arose with my grandfathers health he refused to prescribe him the pain medication he needed The man was extremely unorganized and seemingly knew nothing about my grandfather when he came in He was also extremely rude to my family and caused my entire extended family a great deal of anguish Would not recommend him ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-macario-corpuz-xsrdf, Macario Corpuz Jr ,I honestly had one of the best experiences at a doctors office in my life The PA and Dr Corpuz were very thorough with my exam and were very proactive for my health I have tried looking around for a Pcp but was never satisfied with the care Dr Corpuz is an excellent physician ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-macario-corpuz-xsrdf, Macario Corpuz Jr ,Very poor bedside manner Half the time it seems like he is not listening to you I would not feel comfortable having him as my doctor if I had a health concern,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-macario-corpuz-xsrdf, Macario Corpuz Jr ,The man does nothing for his patients He has memory lapses and will tell you about another patient he has who suffers from the same thing as you You realize he's talking about you A guy this young shouldn't be showing signs of dementia He should not be allowed to practice medicine His license should be suspended ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tammy-vargas-2qs4v, Tammy Vargas ,Dr Vargas has been my PCP for over 25 years She has treated me with respect listened to my concerns and sent me to specialists when needed She can run a bit late for appointments Her staff isn't always on the ball I wouldn't have stayed with her if she wasn't an excellent doctor ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-tammy-vargas-2qs4v, Tammy Vargas ,Doctor Vargas' bedside manor is absolutely terrible She is extremely rude and self important I am the son of a physician My father would have never treated his patients in such a manor She did not listen to any of my concerns she interrupted me to walk out of the room several times leaving the door open to speak to other patients and staff  without discretion  She even used profanity in our conversation Additionally I had to wait over six weeks for an appointment for a sick visit ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-gabrielle-sousa-2s55d, Gabrielle Sousa ,As a new patient I'd hoped for a decent conversation to discuss current concerns or at the very least the items I had written down on one of their required forms My appt started 45 minutes late and I didn't even get a handshake Instead I felt like I was being quizzed perhaps I should have written down my entire health history in the event my prior office did not send everything over I suppose my idea of a new patient appt is incorrect Shewas also supposed to recheck my BP she didn't ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-gabrielle-sousa-2s55d, Gabrielle Sousa ,Took off work early to be seen for a UTI I saw Dr Souza She said she would call in the prescription for antibiotics THAT night As she flew out of the room I followed her to confirm that she indeed called the prescription in and confirmed the correct pharmacy Even saying  so when I get there they should have it  She never called it in Another doctor simply told me she forgot ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-gabrielle-sousa-2s55d, Gabrielle Sousa ,Dr Sousa did not take the time to hear what my concerns were I felt completely dismissed and that she obviously had more important things to do other than being my doctor I left with more questions than when I arrived I will be requesting to be seen by a different provider from now on ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-gabrielle-sousa-2s55d, Gabrielle Sousa ,I would give zero but you dont list that,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-ronald-volney-3329f, Ronald Volney ,Definitely not recommended Once he makes a judgement about you he puts assumptions above patient care will cut you off while you're explaining what your issue is and the average appointment time is about 5 minutes and consists of lecturing you and setting an appointment months away without any heed to what is going with you ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-ronald-volney-3329f, Ronald Volney ,If you like being whisked through a visit with recommendations for OTC drugs to hide your symptoms being told come back in six weeks with promises of scans that never happen then to have the same process repeat on your follow up this guy is for you Awful My condition was exactly as bad as I insisted on the first visit By the third visit still no scan and yet another OTC drug recommendation Avoid him unless you're a pill popper This pharma puppet is just going through the motions ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-jill-waren-xq4tr, Jill Waren ,After many years of trying to find a PCP I really liked I finally found Dr J Waren She was someone who was very easy to talk to about any issues and I felt VERY comfortable with her  Sadly for reasons unknown by me they are closing her practice in New Boston  I am very disappointed and heartbroken to see her go :  ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-neha-robinson-yhdgy, Neha Robinson ,Dr Robinson is a good enough doctor but the office staff is rude and dismissive I won't go back there Due to traffic I was five minutes late for my appointment not ten minutes not fifteen which I could understand being problematic Five minutes They turned me away The doctor could have seen me for the last ten minutes of my appointment but said no That is unkind rude and wrong This was a sick visit ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-howard-suls-yh6ch, Howard Suls ,The staff is rude and hard to get on the phone Overall a bad experience Cant speak to the other providers in the practice But dr Suls was a negative experience ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-howard-suls-yh6ch, Howard Suls ,During a visit Dr Suls spends more time looking at his laptop than at his patient He can be forgetful and unapologetic Always appears rushed & has a narcissistic style If you call & ask to speak with him you'll get his nurse He never picks up the phone and speaks to his patients He does not have any voice mail coverage You will get a recording or the receptionist who immediately puts ypu on hold Often have to call back I've been treated better at the DMV ,2,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-fadi-wehbi-yms92, Fadi Wehbi ,My experience is pretty much the same as the other low rated reviews it seems that what it matters to the doctor is to check up what the nurse already captured  he has no time for questions and if he spend little more time he will overcharge he literally said to my husband that he was wasting his time ,2,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-debra-garlin-3x4yw, Debra Garlin ,I had to leave the practice because of the lack of respect When you make an appointment it's reasonable to know sometimes doctors run over Maybe by ten fifteen minutes NOT close to an hour My time is important that's why I make appointments Couldn't even see my doctor because my babysitter had to leave from her being so late It's the third time this has happend while seeing her I will not be going back,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-marcin-sprycha-ys32f, Marcin Sprycha ,More of a fingers on  the computer  and questions than a hands on Dr Relies on lab work results instead of actually examining the patient Although he does seem generally interested in your concerns and does make beneficial suggestions not demands and spends time with you to go over everything in his rapid quick polish accent ,4,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-marcin-sprycha-ys32f, Marcin Sprycha ,Dr Sprycha seems remarkably disengaged when discussing my health He provides very little feedback during examinations and what he does offer is always projected with a very flat affect His bedside manner is awkward at best and when you attempt to pry a response from him he mumbles He has little consideration for the value of his patients time and may make you wait for 45 60 minutes beyond the scheduled appointment time ,2,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-paul-swoboda-2wk75, Paul Swoboda ,Dr Swoboda is new to the practice where I have been a patient for 23+ years While I miss the prior pcp I have found Dr Swoboda caring and knowledgeable and gets 4 stars instead of 5 only because I don't know if long enough for the highest grade ,4,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-caitlin-mann-27289, Caitlin Mann ,Dr Mann is such a breath of fresh air It took me years to find such a wonderful physician as her She exudes compassion in a field that has become so much about money and less about empathy and kindness She's intelligent considerate and an absolute joy Her office is over an hour from where I live and let me tell you she is 10 000 worth the drive I wouldn't trade her for any other physician I am so grateful she is my PCP ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-nancy-berley-2c9ld, Nancy Berley ,In my humble opinion Dr Berley doesn't seem to be very analytical or intuitive and in my experience she was not thorough Had she done some pretty basic blood work based on my health concerns she would have found what my new doctor found before my very first appointment and overnight my gut could have been saved Instead I suffered for a while She also charges an extra office visit fee for giving referrals  whether you asked for one or not  I question whether she actually likes people ,2,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-nancy-berley-2c9ld, Nancy Berley ,She is the best Doctor I have ever had,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-azra-ali-xtgdw, Azra Ali ,Dr Ali was my doctor for seven or eight years I was young enough to think I was receiving good treatment until finally larger health issues were found following my own research and insistence on certain labs Then I realized how long I had been cheated of proper care  major issues missed because Dr Ali brushed them off kidney stones in both kidneys with pain for years that she said was nothing and to take ibuprofen She's just not thorough I also had tons of billing issues,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-azra-ali-xtgdw, Azra Ali ,When I told my wife she would consult with Dr Ali she said: Please do not you have another doctor My wife felt a lot of pain in the jaw and needed referral to a specialist and only after being evaluated by the doctor would it be possible well Dr Ali examined it and said she would send the mailing After five days we received nothing and my wife continues to feel strong pains This Dr Ali has the reputation of not giving due attention to patients ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-joseph-spychalski-ygmjl, Joseph Spychalski ,Dr Spychalski was not knowledgeable with any questions I was asking If fact he was unable to answer one He referred me to a surgeon to get a fistula lanced Good thing because I just was looking at him sideways Didn't shake my hand or introduce himself Very odd and kinda creepy personality Not impressed at alll ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-darla-thyng-2n5c2, Darla Thyng ,Probably the most unprofessional person I've ever met She pretty much kicked me out of her office while I was still asking her questions Also during the exam I asked for water or ice which she replied with  you can get that at your house ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-darla-thyng-2n5c2, Darla Thyng ,Best Doctor I've ever had She actually tries to help figure out your issue and resolve it Unlike most doctors that just blame your job and give you aspirin I'm not looking to cover up the problem I'm looking to cure it Thanks Doc Your the best ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-dhrumil-shah-3h6tl, Dhrumil Shah ,Dr shah even realized it was time to move to urgent care The truth will set you free exposed I know a close personal friend that works there and all the doctors are concerned Check out harbor medical in Weymouth I had 2 doctors give a second opinion and incorrect diagnosis 2 doctors ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-dhrumil-shah-3h6tl, Dhrumil Shah ,When my doctor left for urgent care Dr Broderick he took over  very friendly but I felt getting no where  just going through the motions  fake  and nurse the practioners ms Wong stop in check stats I have spoke to many of my clients who also feel the same way Very disappointed  Just a number#,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-dhrumil-shah-3h6tl, Dhrumil Shah ,Dr Shah does nothing When I tell him of a problem he just ignores it or says he doesn't know I have been going to him for 4 years and he doesn't even know I have minor COPD I put it on the intake form but in four years he has never listened to my heart or lungs On my last wellness visit the nurse did the usual stuff she always does Dr Shah came in the room told me I was ok and could go Time spent with me  less than 10 mins Time to look for another doctor ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-dhrumil-shah-3h6tl, Dhrumil Shah ,Dr Shah and his staff are all I could have hoped for in a medical practitioner He has been my primary care physician for several years now and has always provided the absolute best care and I believe best advice and treatment during every visit and for every issue,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-dhrumil-shah-3h6tl, Dhrumil Shah ,Dr Shah works for the corporation not his patients Very charismatic and seems like he really cares but in my opinion he has never made a diagnosis of his own rather works off of others diagnosis For years I was lead to believe there was nothing wrong with me till I went to the e r and was diagnosed in under 20 minutes I had asked him  Shah  to check for something specific and was ignored and told it was all in my head If you believe their is something wrong with yourself seek another doctor,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-smita-kolli-2cxnq, Smita Kolli ,I have not been given the proper care on 2 out of the 4 occasions that I have seen Dr Kolli The problem is that I am told to visit Dr Kolli for sick visits at a large practice with many doctors when my doctor is over booked Her appointments are booked about 10 minutes apart so she has to make quick decisions when more time is needed Two times I was released without testing and told my condition wasn't serious Both of those times ended with hospitalization and delay of proper care ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/jessica-launh-78fgz,Jessica Launh ,I had an appt with Jessica Launh APRN I went into the appointment with 1 question about the birth control she had prescribed me the previous month She left the room to ask somebody else about it and came back and told me I didn't need to take the last week of pills in the pack because they were sugar pills Come to find out this is 100 incorrect for Camilia Birth control As someone who just had two  planned  kids in the past two years I'm diligent at taking my BC since our family is complete,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/amanda-coffey-3ml54,Amanda Coffey ,Amanda is fabulous She takes the time to listen to my concerns and is thorough with diagnosis and options She has made me feel like a valued patient for years ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/amanda-coffey-3ml54,Amanda Coffey ,I saw Amanda Coffee once for my annual exam after my primary care doctor departed tithe practice She didn't know me know my lifestyle or want to understand but rather was very judgmental critical and antagonistic during our pre exam question session I did not feel comfortable that my best interests were her priority  she had a cookie cutter idea of how women my age should be and what must fit I endured the exam and shortly there after found a new health care provider Amherst Family Practice is otherwise a wonderful facility  the staff is friendly helpful and prompt This experience was a completely incongruous with my usual experience ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/amanda-coffey-3ml54,Amanda Coffey ,I saw Amanda Coffey exactly once A week later when her prescribed treatment proved ineffective she refused to see me and proceded to write something in my chart that caused another doctor in the office refuse to treat me without first consulting with her Take note that she is not even a doctor Although I belonged to this practice for over 3 years  seeing her just once  I feel I have no choice but to leave the entire hospital network Dangerously judgmental individual ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-pamela-coury-y3f4f, Pamela Coury ,Very friendly and approachable She takes her time and really listens to you she shows true concerning ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-j-gavin-muir-392ls, J Gavin Muir ,The staff under him determines who he sees He is not getting the right info The need to get the proper screener for his patients has to be addressed It is very weak It has happened to me Great Doctor poor support team ,5,

https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-kristin-schofield-27qgv, Kristin Schofield ,I have been seeing Dr Schofield for close to 10 years She has an excellent bedside manner was always responsive to any questions or request that I made I would absolutely recommend her to someone else who was looking for a primary care Love her and her office staff ,5,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-alok-sinha-xfcsx, Alok Sinha ,Combative negligent and dismissive Seemed totally annoyed to do his own job I implore you to take your loved one elsewhere ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-alok-sinha-xfcsx, Alok Sinha ,Would never recommend Dr Sinha It was recommended by one dr that my elderly mother who was in the ER with unexplained stomach pains have a consult with gastroenterologist and he decided that wasn't necessary He discharged her with a dx of acid reflux despite no symptoms He came across as smarmy and only concerned with Hospital rating my mother could give on patient feedback form,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-alok-sinha-xfcsx, Alok Sinha ,Horrible example of a doctor Not only does he have no compassion for patients he is completely rude and has no interest in listening to what the patient or family has to say and questions are not an option Ask a question and he will make you feel stupid Interested in a provider who thinks they are of a higher power and has no respect for anyone else  feel free to see this man This man should not practice medicine on animals let alone humans a complete disgrace to the medical profession ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-alok-sinha-xfcsx, Alok Sinha ,In My opinion he had an absolutely HORRIBLE bedside manner Very hard to understand through his thick accent No compassion for my elderly mother who was under the influence of pain medications when he interviewed her in the ER for admission to the hospital  broken hip  His tone while questioning was strong and he had to repeat himself multiple times  I couldn't understand him either  He then asked her DNR questions and her responses were opposite her legally recorded ones ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-alok-sinha-xfcsx, Alok Sinha ,I was admitted to the hospital after having chronic diarrhea and vomiting for 3 weeks My admitting doctor recommended a GI specialist Dr Sinha did not think a conversation with the GI specialist was warranted until my nurse and I insisted The GI team urged and ran further tests to find the root cause I spoke to Dr Sinha three times and all three times he was more concerned with insurance costs and getting me released versus finding a definitive cause for my symptoms ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-ana-goubert-x5rlg, Ana Goubert ,Inattentive and impersonal ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-phat-nguyen-y7pn5, Phat Nguyen ,He shows a lack of interest of your problems even when you tell him what is bothering you  Book educated and never listens what your concerns may be common sense plays no role with him  I have issues that men get at a certain age but he refuses to help and says it's life  My wife told me that the doctors there have 15 mins with patient unless you ask for more time  My last visit this week was 15 mins exactly Next ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-phat-nguyen-y7pn5, Phat Nguyen ,He didn't seem like he cared to find the cause of my pain He simply said he didn't know what was causing it and that was the end of the appointment A complete waste of time/,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-phat-nguyen-y7pn5, Phat Nguyen ,I went to get forms completed to go on short term disability for work It then took 3 tries for him to complete the form even semi adequately He didn't even put his name on the first try He was also completely uninterested in trying to find out what was wrong with me He just kept saying I don't know and didn't care about finding answers I had to ask to have blood tests done If you must see this doctor do your own research and be prepared to bully him into doing anything to help you ,1,

https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/kristy-fassler-3lyxn, Kristy Fassler ,I feel sad writing this review but it needs to be said While kind Dr Fassler misdiagnosed me and failed to discover my autoimmune disease despite clear signs pointing to it I felt like she was guessing constantly instead of coming from a place of knowledge and research I spent THOUSANDS with Dr Fassler with costly supplements and in house blood work  please don't let her talk you into getting the rip off Boston Heart Health test   I finally got wise and didn't go back I then struggled for two more years without seeing anyone else  I had no money left  until my condition became an emergency and I received my diagnosis I am angry at the wasted time and trust I put into Dr Fassler As I learn about my diagnosis there were clear telltale signs of my autoimmune disease that she missed Please do not go and see this doctor ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/kristy-fassler-3lyxn, Kristy Fassler ,I wish I had read other people's reviews before seeing Kristy Without going into great length on my horrible health journey I will say I absolutely went to her healthy and through her treatment I got sick My advice is to stay away  I had to submit a star rating if I didn't have to it would have been none  ,1,
https://www.healthgrades.com/providers/kristy-fassler-3lyxn, Kristy Fassler ,Even though Dr Fassler is kind she treated me for the wrong condition and missed several key other conditions I had I wanted to trust her but her protocol made my condition worse and caused other health problems ,2,
